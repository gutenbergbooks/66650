<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have ventured in the present volume to gather together, under the somewhat loose
and inaccurate title of <i>The Life of the Grasshopper</i>, the essays scattered over the <i lang="fr">Souvenirs entomologiques</i> that treat of Grasshoppers, Crickets, Locusts and such insects as the Cicada, or
<i>Cigale</i>, the Mantis and the Cuckoo-spit, or, to adopt the author’s happier and more euphonious
term, the Foamy Cicadella. They exhaust the number of the orthopterous and homopterous
insects discussed by Henri Fabre.
</p>
<p>Chapters I. to VIII., XV., XVI. and XIX. have already appeared, in certain cases under
different titles and partly in an abbreviated form, in an interesting miscellany extracted
from the <i lang="fr">Souvenirs</i>, translated by Mr. Bernard Miall and published by the Century Company. This volume,
<i>Social Life in the Insect World</i>, is illustrated with admirable photographs of insects, taken from life, and deserves
a prominent place on the shelves of every lover of Fabre’s works.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the moment of writing, the only one of the following essays that has been published
before, in my translation, is the first of the three describing the White-faced Decticus,
which appeared, in the summer of last year, in the <i>English Review</i>.
</p>
<p>Miss Frances Rodwell has again lent me the most valuable assistance in preparing this
volume; and I am indebted also to Mr. Osman Edwards and Mr. Stephen McKenna for their
graceful rhymed versions of the occasional lyrics that adorn it.

<h2 class="main">THE FABLE OF THE CICADA AND THE ANT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fame is built up mainly of legend; in the animal world, as in the world of men, the
story takes precedence of history. Insects in particular, whether they attract our
attention in this way or in that, have their fair share in a folk-lore which pays
but little regard to truth.
</p>
<p>For instance, who does not know the Cicada, at least by name? Where, in the entomological
world, can we find a renown that equals hers? Her reputation as an inveterate singer,
who takes no thought for the future, has formed a subject for our earliest exercises
in repetition. In verses that are very easily learnt, she is shown to us, when the
bitter winds begin to blow, quite destitute and hurrying to her neighbour, the Ant,
to announce her hunger. The would-be borrower meets with a poor <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>welcome and with a reply which has remained proverbial and is the chief cause of the
little creature’s fame. Those two short lines,
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter xd31e452">
<p class="line"><i>Vous chantiez! J’en suis bien en aise.</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>Eh bien, dansez maintenant</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e459src" href="#xd31e459">1</a> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">with their petty malice, have done more for the Cicada’s celebrity than all her talent
as a musician. They enter the child’s mind like a wedge and never leave it.
</p>
<p>To most of us, the Cicada’s song is unknown, for she dwells in the land of the olive-trees;
but we all, big and little, have heard of the snub which she received from the Ant.
See how reputations are made! A story of very doubtful value, offending as much against
morality as against natural history; a nursery-tale whose only merit lies in its brevity:
there we have the origin of a renown which will tower over the ruins of the centuries
like Hop-o’-my-Thumb’s boots and Little Red-Riding-Hood’s basket.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>The child is essentially conservative. Custom and traditions become indestructible
once they are confided to the archives of his memory. We owe to him the celebrity
of the Cicada, whose woes he stammered in his first attempts at recitation. He preserves
for us the glaring absurdities that are part and parcel of the fable: the Cicada will
always be hungry when the cold comes, though there are no Cicadæ left in the winter;
she will always beg for the alms of a few grains of wheat, a food quite out of keeping
with her delicate sucker; the supplicant is supposed to hunt for Flies and grubs,
she who never eats!
</p>
<p>Whom are we to hold responsible for these curious blunders? La Fontaine,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e475src" href="#xd31e475">2</a> who charms us in most of his fables with his exquisite delicacy of observation, is
very ill-inspired in this case. He knows thoroughly his common subjects, the Fox,
the Wolf, the Cat, the Goat, the Crow, the Rat, the Weasel and many others, whose
sayings and doings he describes to us with delightful precision of detail. They are
local characters, neighbours, housemates of his. Their <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>public and private life is spent under his eyes; but, where Jack Rabbit gambols, the
Cicada is an entire stranger: La Fontaine never heard of her, never saw her. To him
the famous singer is undoubtedly a Grasshopper.
</p>
<p>Grandville,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e485src" href="#xd31e485">3</a> whose drawings have the same delicious spice of malice as the text itself, falls
into the same error. In his illustration, we see the Ant arrayed like an industrious
housewife. Standing on her threshold, beside great sacks of wheat, she turns a contemptuous
back on the borrower, who is holding out her foot, I beg pardon, her hand. The second
figure wears a great cartwheel hat, with a guitar under her arm and her skirt plastered
to her legs by the wind, and is the perfect picture of a Grasshopper. Grandville no
more than La Fontaine suspected the real appearance of the Cicada; he reproduced magnificently
the general mistake.
</p>
<p>For the rest, La Fontaine, in his poor <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>little story, only echoes another fabulist. The legend of the Cicada’s sorry welcome
by the Ant is as old as selfishness, that is to say, as old as the world. The children
of Athens, going to school with their esparto-grass baskets crammed with figs and
olives, were already mumbling it as a piece for recitation:
</p>
<p>“In winter,” said they, “the Ants dry their wet provisions in the sun. Up comes a
hungry Cicada begging. She asks for a few grains. The greedy hoarders reply, ‘You
used to sing in summer; now dance in winter.’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e505src" href="#xd31e505">4</a>
</p>
<p>This, although a little more baldly put, is precisely La Fontaine’s theme and is contrary
to all sound knowledge.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless the fable comes to us from Greece, which is preeminently the land of
olive-trees and Cicadæ. Was Æsop really the author, as tradition pretends? It is doubtful.
Nor does it matter, after all: the narrator is a Greek and a fellow-countryman of
the Cicada, whom he must know well enough. My village does not contain a peasant so
ignorant as to be unaware of the absolute lack of Cicadæ in winter; every tiller of
the soil is familiar with the insect’s primary state, the larva, which he turns over
with his spade as often as he has occasion to bank up the olive-trees at the approach
of the cold weather; he knows, from seeing it a thousand times along the paths, how
this grub leaves the ground through a round pit of its own making, how it fastens
on to some twig, splits its back, divests itself of its skin, now drier than shrivelled
parchment, and turns into the Cicada, pale grass-green at first, soon to be succeeded
by brown.
</p>
<p>The Attic peasant was no fool either: he had remarked that which cannot escape the
least observant eye; he also knew what my rustic neighbours know so well. The poet,
whoever he may have been, who invented the fable was writing under the best conditions
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>for knowing all about these things. Then whence did the blunders in his story arise?
</p>
<p>The Greek fabulist had less excuse than La Fontaine for portraying the Cicada of the
books instead of going to the actual Cicada, whose cymbals were echoing at his side;
heedless of the real, he followed tradition. He himself was but echoing a more ancient
scribe; he was repeating some legend handed down from India, the venerable mother
of civilizations. Without knowing exactly the story which the Hindu’s reed had put
in writing to show the danger of a life led without foresight, we are entitled to
believe that the little dialogue set down was nearer to the truth than the conversation
between the Cicada and the Ant. India, the great lover of animals, was incapable of
committing such a mistake. Everything seems to tell us that the leading figure in
the original fable was not our Cicada but rather some other creature, an insect if
you will, whose habits corresponded fittingly with the text adopted.
</p>
<p>Imported into Greece, after serving for centuries to make the wise reflect and to
amuse the children on the banks of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>Indus, the ancient story, perhaps as old as the first piece of economical advice vouchsafed
by Paterfamilias and handed down more or less faithfully from memory to memory, must
have undergone an alteration in its details, as do all legends which the course of
the ages adapts to circumstances of time and place.
</p>
<p>The Greek, not possessing in his fields the insect of which the Hindu spoke, dragged
in, as the nearest thing to it, the Cicada, even as in Paris, the modern Athens, the
Cicada is replaced by the Grasshopper. The mischief was done. Henceforth ineradicable,
since it has been confided to the memory of childhood, the mistake will prevail against
an obvious truth.
</p>
<p>Let us try to rehabilitate the singer slandered by the fable. He is, I hasten to admit,
an importunate neighbour. Every summer he comes and settles in his hundreds outside
my door, attracted by the greenery of two tall plane-trees; and here, from sunrise
to sunset, the rasping of his harsh symphony goes through my head. Amid this deafening
concert, thought is impossible; one’s ideas reel and whirl, are incapable of concentrating.
When I have not profited by <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>the early hours of the morning, my day is lost.
</p>
<p>Oh, little demon, plague of my dwelling which I should like to have so peaceful, they
say that the Athenians used to rear you in a cage to enjoy your singing at their ease!
One we could do with, perhaps, during the drowsy hour of digestion; but hundreds at
a time, all rattling and drumming in our ears when we are trying to collect our thoughts,
that is sheer torture! You say that you were here first, do you? Before I came, you
were in undisputed possession of the two plane-trees; and it is I who am the intruder
there. I agree. Nevertheless, muffle your drums, moderate your arpeggios, for the
sake of your biographer!
</p>
<p>Truth will have none of the absurd rigmarole which we find in the fable. That there
are sometimes relations between the Cicada and the Ant is most certain; only, these
relations are the converse of what we are told. They are not made on the initiative
of the Cicada, who is never dependent on the aid of others for his living; they come
from the Ant, a greedy spoiler, who monopolizes every edible thing for her granaries.
At no time does the Cicada go <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>crying famine at the doors of the Ant-hills, promising honestly to repay principal
and interest; on the contrary, it is the Ant who, driven by hunger, begs and entreats
the singer. Entreats, do I say? Borrowing and repaying form no part of the pillager’s
habits. She despoils the Cicada, brazenly robs him of his possessions. Let us describe
this theft, a curious point in natural history and, as yet, unknown.
</p>
<p>In July, during the stifling heat of the afternoon, when the insect populace, parched
with thirst, vainly wanders around the limp and withered flowers in search of refreshment,
the Cicada laughs at the general need. With that delicate gimlet, his rostrum, he
broaches a cask in his inexhaustible cellar. Sitting, always singing, on the branch
of a shrub, he bores through the firm, smooth bark swollen with sap ripened by the
sun. Driving his sucker through the bung-hole, he drinks luxuriously, motionless and
rapt in contemplation, absorbed in the charms of syrup and song.
</p>
<p>Watch him for a little while. We shall perhaps witness unexpected tribulation. There
are many thirsty ones prowling around, in fact; they discover the well betrayed <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>by the sap that oozes from the margin. They hasten up, at first with some discretion,
confining themselves to licking the fluid as it exudes. I see gathering around the
mellifluous puncture Wasps, Flies, Earwigs, Sphex-wasps,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e540src" href="#xd31e540">5</a> Pompili,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e546src" href="#xd31e546">6</a> Rose-chafers<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e552src" href="#xd31e552">7</a> and, above all, Ants.
</p>
<p>The smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the abdomen of the Cicada, who
good-naturedly raises himself on his legs and leaves a free passage for the intruders;
the larger ones, unable to stand still for impatience, quickly snatch a sip, retreat,
take a walk on the neighbouring branches and then return and show greater enterprise.
The coveting becomes more eager; the discreet ones of a moment ago develop into turbulent
aggressors, ready to chase away from the spring the well-sinker who caused it to gush
forth.
</p>
<p>In this brigandage, the worst offenders <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>are the Ants. I have seen them nibbling at the ends of the Cicada’s legs; I have caught
them tugging at the tips of his wings, climbing on his back, tickling his antennæ.
One, greatly daring, went to the length, before my eyes, of catching hold of his sucker
and trying to pull it out.
</p>
<p>Thus worried by these pigmies and losing all patience, the giant ends by abandoning
the well. He flees, spraying the robbers with his urine as he goes. What cares the
Ant for this expression of supreme contempt! Her object is attained. She is now the
mistress of the spring, which dries up only too soon when the pump that made it flow
ceases to work. There is little of it, but that little is exquisite. It is so much
to the good, enabling her to wait for another draught, acquired in the same fashion,
as soon as the occasion presents itself.
</p>
<p>You see, the actual facts entirely reverse the parts assigned in the fable. The hardened
beggar, who does not shrink from theft, is the Ant; the industrious artisan, gladly
sharing his possessions with the sufferer, is the Cicada. I will mention one more
detail; and the reversal of characters will stand out even more clearly. After five
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>or six weeks of wassail, which is a long space of time, the singer, exhausted by the
strain of life, drops from the tree. The sun dries up the body; the feet of the passers-by
crush it. The Ant, always a highway-robber in search of spoil, comes upon it. She
cuts up the rich dish, dissects it, carves it and reduces it to morsels which go to
swell her hoard of provisions. It is not unusual to see a dying Cicada, with his wing
still quivering in the dust, drawn and quartered by a gang of knackers. He is quite
black with them. After this cannibalistic proceeding, there is no question as to the
true relations between the two insects.
</p>
<p>The ancients held the Cicada in high favour. Anacreon, the Greek Béranger,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e570src" href="#xd31e570">8</a> devoted an ode to singing his praises in curiously exaggerated language:
</p>
<p>“Thou art almost like unto the gods,” says he.
</p>
<p>The reasons which he gives for this apotheosis are none of the best. They consist
of these three privileges: <span class="trans" title="gēgenēs, apathēs, anaimosarke"><span lang="grc" class="grek">γηγενής, απαθής, ὰναιμόσαρκε</span></span>; earthborn, insensible to pain, bloodless. Let us not start reproaching <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>the poet for these blunders, which were generally believed at the time and perpetuated
for very long after, until the observer’s searching eyes were opened. Besides, it
does not do to look so closely at verses whose chief merit lies in harmony and rhythm.
</p>
<p>Even in our own days, the Provençal poets, who are at least as familiar with the Cicada
as Anacreon was, are not so very careful of the truth in celebrating the insect which
they take as an emblem. One of my friends, a fervent observer and a scrupulous realist,
escapes this reproach. He has authorized me to take from his unpublished verse the
following Provençal ballad, which depicts the relations between the Cicada and the
Ant with strictly scientific accuracy. I leave to him the responsibility for his poetic
images and his moral views, delicate flowers outside my province as a naturalist;
but I can vouch for the truth of his story, which tallies with what I see every summer
on the lilac-trees in my garden.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CICADA: LEAVING THE BURROW</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To come back to the Cicada after Réaumur<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e946src" href="#xd31e946">1</a> has told the insect’s story would be waste of time, save that the disciple enjoys
an advantage unknown to the master. The great naturalist received the materials for
his work from my part of the world; his subjects came by barge after being carefully
preserved in spirits. I, on the other hand, live in the Cicada’s company. When July
comes, he takes possession of the enclosure right up to the threshold of the house.
The hermitage is our joint property. I remain master indoors; but out of doors he
is the sovereign lord and an extremely noisy and abusive one. Our near neighbourhood
and constant association <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>have enabled me to enter into certain details of which Réaumur could not dream.
</p>
<p>The first Cicadæ appear at the time of the summer solstice. Along the much-trodden
paths baked by the sun and hardened by the frequent passage of feet there open, level
with the ground, round orifices about the size of a man’s thumb. These are the exit-holes
of the Cicada-larvæ, who come up from the depths to undergo their transformation on
the surface. They are more or less everywhere, except in soil turned over by the plough.
Their usual position is in the driest spots, those most exposed to the sun, especially
by the side of the roads. Equipped with powerful tools to pass, if necessary, through
sandstone and dried clay, the larva, on leaving the earth, has a fancy for the hardest
places.
</p>
<p>One of the garden-paths, converted into a little inferno by the glare from a wall
facing south, abounds in such exit-holes. I proceed, in the last days of June, to
examine these recently abandoned pits. The soil is so hard that I have to take my
pickaxe to tackle it.
</p>
<p>The orifices are round and nearly an inch in diameter. There is absolutely no rubbish
around them, no mound of earth thrown up <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>outside. This is invariably the case: the Cicada’s hole is never surmounted with a
mole-hill, as are the burrows of the Geotrupes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e961src" href="#xd31e961">2</a> or Dorbeetles, those other sturdy excavators. The manner of working accounts for
this difference. The Dung-beetle progresses from the outside inwards; he commences
his digging at the mouth of the well, which allows him to ascend and heap up on the
surface the material which he has extracted. The larva of the Cicada, on the other
hand, goes from the inside outwards; the last thing that it does is to open the exit-door,
which, remaining closed until the very end of the work, cannot be used for getting
rid of the rubbish. The former goes in and makes a mound on the threshold of the home;
the latter comes out and cannot heap up anything on a threshold that does not yet
exist.
</p>
<p>The Cicada’s tunnel runs to a depth of between fifteen and sixteen inches. It is cylindrical,
winds slightly, according to the exigencies of the soil, and is always nearly perpendicular,
for it is shorter to go that way. The passage is quite open throughout <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>its length. It is useless to search for the rubbish which this excavation ought, one
would think, to produce; we see none anywhere. The tunnel ends in a blind alley, in
a rather wider chamber, with level walls and not the least vestige of communication
with any gallery prolonging the well.
</p>
<p>Reckoned by its length and its diameter, the excavation represents a volume of about
twelve cubic inches. What has become of the earth removed? Sunk in very dry and very
loose soil, the well and the chamber at the bottom ought to have crumbly walls, which
would easily fall in, if nothing else had taken place but the work of boring. My surprise
was great to find, on the contrary, coated surfaces, washed with a paste of clayey
earth. They are not by a long way what one could call smooth, but at any rate their
irregularities are covered with a layer of plaster; and their slippery materials,
soaked with some agglutinant, are kept in position.
</p>
<p>The larva can move about and climb nearly up to the surface and down again to its
refuge at the bottom without producing, with its clawed legs, landslips which would
block the tube, making ascent difficult and <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>retreat impossible. The miner shores up his galleries with pit-props and cross-beams;
the builder of underground railways strengthens his tunnels with a casing of brickwork;
the Cicada’s larva, which is quite as clever an engineer, cements its shaft so as
to keep it open however long it may have to serve.
</p>
<p>If I surprise the creature at the moment when it emerges from the soil to make for
a neighbouring branch and there undergo its transformation, I see it at once beat
a prudent retreat and, without the slightest difficulty, run down again to the bottom
of its gallery, proving that, even when the dwelling is on the point of being abandoned
for good, it does not become blocked with earth.
</p>
<p>The ascending-shaft is not a piece of work improvised in a hurry, in the insect’s
impatience to reach the sunlight; it is a regular manor-house, an abode in which the
grub is meant to make a long stay. So the plastered walls tell us. Any such precaution
would be superfluous in the case of a mere exit abandoned as soon as bored. There
is not a doubt but that we have here a sort of meteorological station in which observations
are taken of the weather outside. Underground, fifteen inches down, or more, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>larva ripe for its emergence is hardly able to judge whether the climatic conditions
be favourable. Its subterranean weather is too gradual in its changes to be able to
supply it with the precise indications necessary for the most important action of
its life, its escape into the sunlight for the metamorphosis.
</p>
<p>Patiently, for weeks, perhaps for months, it digs, clears and strengthens a perpendicular
chimney, leaving at the surface, to keep it sequestered from the world without, a
layer as thick as one’s finger. At the bottom it makes itself a recess more carefully
built than the remainder. This is its refuge, its waiting-room, where it rests if
its reconnoitring lead it to defer its emigration. At the least suspicion of fine
weather, it scrambles up, tests the exterior through the thin layer of earth forming
a lid and enquires into the temperature and the degree of humidity of the air.
</p>
<p>If things do not bode well, if a heavy shower threaten or a blustering storm—events
of supreme importance when the delicate Cicada throws off her skin—the prudent insect
slips back to the bottom of the tube and goes on waiting. If, on the other hand, the
atmospheric conditions be favourable, <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>then the ceiling is smashed with a few strokes of the claws and the larva emerges
from the well.
</p>
<p>Everything seems to confirm that the Cicada’s gallery is a waiting-room, a meteorological
station where the larva stays for a long time, now hoisting itself near the surface
to discover the state of the weather, now retreating to the depths for better shelter.
This explains the convenience of a resting-place at the base and the need for a strong
cement on walls which, without it, would certainly give way under continual comings
and goings.
</p>
<p>What is not so easily explained is the complete disappearance of the rubbish corresponding
with the space excavated. What has become of the twelve cubic inches of earth yielded
by an average well? There is nothing outside to represent them, nor anything inside
either. And then how, in a soil dry as cinders, is the plaster obtained with which
the walls are glazed?
</p>
<p>Larvæ that gnaw into wood, such as those of the Capricorn and the Buprestes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e991src" href="#xd31e991">3</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>for instance, ought to be able to answer the first question. They make their way inside
a tree-trunk, boring galleries by eating the materials of the road which they open.
Detached in tiny fragments by the mandibles, these materials are digested. They pass
through the pioneer’s body from end to end, yielding up their meagre nutritive elements
on the way, and accumulate behind, completely blocking the road which the grub will
never take again. The work of excessive division and subdivision, done either by the
mandibles or the stomach, causes the digested materials to take up less room than
the untouched wood; and the result is a space in front of the gallery, a chamber in
which the grub works, a chamber which is greatly restricted in length, giving the
prisoner just enough room to move about.
</p>
<p>Can it not be in a similar fashion that the Cicada-grub bores its tunnel? Certainly
the waste material flung up as it digs its way does not pass through its body; even
if the soil were of the softest and most yielding character, earth plays no part whatever
in the larva’s food. But, after all, cannot the materials removed be simply shot back
as the work proceeds? The Cicada remains <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>four years in the ground. This long life is not, of course, spent at the bottom of
the well which we have described: this is just a place where the larva prepares for
its emergence. It comes from elsewhere, doubtless from some distance. It is a vagabond,
going from one root to another and driving its sucker into each. When it moves, either
to escape from the upper layers, which are too cold in winter, or to settle down at
a better drinking-bar, it clears a road by flinging behind it the materials broken
up by its pickaxes. This is undoubtedly the method.
</p>
<p>As with the larvæ of the Capricorn and the Buprestes, the traveller needs around him
only the small amount of free room which his movements require. Damp, soft, easily
compressed earth is to this larva what the digested pap is to the others. Such earth
is heaped up without difficulty; it condenses and leaves a vacant space.
</p>
<p>The difficulty is one of a different kind with the exit-well bored in a very dry soil,
which offers a marked resistance to compression so long as it retains its aridity.
That the larva, when beginning to dig its passage, flung back part of the excavated
materials into an earlier gallery which has now disappeared <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>is fairly probable, though there is nothing in the condition of things to tell us
so; but, if we consider the capacity of the well and the extreme difficulty of finding
room for so great a volume of rubbish, our doubts return and we say to ourselves:
</p>
<p>“This rubbish demanded a large empty space, which itself was obtained by shifting
other refuse no less difficult to house. The room required presupposes the existence
of another space into which the earth extracted was shot.”
</p>
<p>And so we find ourselves in a vicious circle, for the mere subsidence of materials
flung behind would not be enough to explain so great a void. The Cicada must have
a special method of disposing of the superfluous earth. Let us try and surprise his
secret.
</p>
<p>Examine a larva at the moment when it emerges from the ground. It is nearly always
more or less soiled with mud, sometimes wet, sometimes dry. The digging-implements,
the fore-feet, have the points of their pickaxes stuck in a globule of slime; its
other legs are cased in mud; its back is spotted with clay. We are reminded of a scavenger
who has been stirring up sewage. <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>These stains are the more striking inasmuch as the creature comes out of exceedingly
dry ground. We expected to see it covered with dust and we find it covered with mud.
</p>
<p>One more step in this direction and the problem of the well is solved. I exhume a
larva which happens to be working at its exit-gallery. Very occasionally, I get a
piece of luck like this, in the course of my digging; it would be useless for me to
try for it, as there is nothing outside to guide my search. My welcome prize is just
beginning its excavations. An inch of tunnel, free from any rubbish, and the waiting-room
at the bottom represent all the work for the moment. In what condition is the worker?
We shall see.
</p>
<p>The grub is much paler in colour than those which I catch as they emerge. Its big
eyes in particular are whitish, cloudy, squinting and apparently of little use for
seeing. What good is sight underground? The eyes of the larvæ issuing from the earth
are, on the contrary, black and shining and indicate ability to see. When it makes
its appearance in the sunshine, the future Cicada has to seek, occasionally at some
distance from the exit-hole, the hanging <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>branch on which the metamorphosis will be performed; and here sight will manifestly
be useful. This maturity of vision attained during the preparation for the release
is enough to show us that the larva, far from hastily improvising its ascending-shaft,
works at it for a long time.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the pale and blind larva is bulkier than it is in the state of maturity.
It is swollen with liquid and looks dropsical. If you take it in your fingers, a limpid
humour oozes from the hinder part and moistens the whole body. Is this fluid, expelled
from the intestines, a urinary product? Is it just the residue of a stomach fed solely
on sap? I will not decide the question and will content myself with calling it urine,
merely for convenience.
</p>
<p>Well, this fountain of urine is the key to the mystery. The larva, as it goes on and
digs, sprinkles the dusty materials and makes them into paste, which is forthwith
applied to the walls by abdominal pressure. The original dryness is succeeded by plasticity.
The mud obtained penetrates the interstices of a rough soil; the more liquid part
of it trickles in front; the remainder is compressed and packed and occupies the empty
<span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>spaces in between. Thus is an unblocked tunnel obtained, without any refuse, because
the dust and rubbish are used on the spot in the form of a mortar which is more compact
and more homogeneous than the soil traversed.
</p>
<p>The larva therefore works in the midst of clayey mire; and this is the cause of the
stains that astonish us so much when we see it issuing from excessively dry soil.
The perfect insect, though relieved henceforth from all mining labour, does not utterly
abandon the use of its bladder; a few drains of urine are preserved as a weapon of
defence. When too closely observed, it discharges a spray at the intruder and quickly
flies away. In either form, the Cicada, his dry constitution notwithstanding, proves
himself a skilled irrigator.
</p>
<p>Dropsical though it be, the larva cannot carry sufficient liquid to moisten and turn
into compressible mud the long column of earth which has to be tunnelled. The reservoir
becomes exhausted and the supply has to be renewed. How is this done and when? I think
I see.
</p>
<p>The few wells which I have laid bare throughout their length, with the painstaking
<span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>care which this sort of digging demands, show me at the bottom, encrusted in the wall
of the terminal chamber, a live root, sometimes as big as a lead-pencil, sometimes
no thicker than a straw. The visible part of this root is quite small, barely a fraction
of an inch. The rest is contained in the surrounding earth. Is the discovery of this
sort of sap fortuitous? Or is it the result of a special search on the larva’s part?
The presence of a rootlet is so frequent, at least when my digging is skilfully conducted,
that I rather favour the latter alternative.
</p>
<p>Yes, the Cicada-grub, when hollowing out its cell, the starting-point of the future
chimney, seeks the immediate neighbourhood of a small live root; it lays bare a certain
portion, which continues the side wall without projecting. This live spot in the wall
is, I think, the fount from which the contents of the urinary bladder are renewed
as the need arises. When its reserves are exhausted by the conversion of dry dust
into mud, the miner goes down to his chamber, drives in his sucker and takes a deep
draught from the cask built into the wall. With his jug well filled, he goes up again.
He resumes his work, wetting the hard earth the <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>better to flatten it with his claws and reducing the dusty rubbish to mud which can
be heaped up around him and leave a clear thoroughfare. That is how things must happen.
So logic and the circumstances of the case tell us, in the absence of direct observation,
which is not feasible here.
</p>
<p>If this root-cask fail, if moreover the reservoir of the intestine be exhausted, what
will happen then? We shall learn from the following experiment. I catch a grub as
it is leaving the ground. I put it at the bottom of a test-tube and cover it with
a column of dry earth, not too closely packed. The column is nearly six inches high.
The larva has just quitted an excavation thrice as deep, in soil of the same nature,
but offering a much greater resistance. Now that it is buried under my short, sandy
column, will it be capable of climbing to the surface? If it were a mere matter of
strength, the issue would be certain. What can an obstacle without cohesion be to
one that has just bored a hole through the hard ground?
</p>
<p>And yet I am assailed by doubts. To break down the screen that still separated it
from the outer air, the larva has expended its last reserves of fluid. The flask is
dry; <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>and there is no way of replenishing it in the absence of a live root. My suspicion
of failure is well-founded. For three days I see the entombed one wasting itself in
efforts without succeeding in rising an inch higher. The materials removed refuse
to stay in position for lack of anything to bind them; they are no sooner pushed aside
than they slip down again under the insect’s legs. The labour has no perceptible result
and has always to be done all over again. On the fourth day, the creature dies.
</p>
<p>With the water-can full, the result is quite different. I subject to the same experiment
an insect whose work of self-deliverance is just beginning. It is all swollen with
urinary humours which ooze out and moisten its whole body. This one’s task is easy.
The materials offer hardly any resistance. A little moisture, supplied by the miner’s
flask, converts them into mud, sticks them together and keeps them out of the way.
The passage is opened, very irregular in shape, it is true, and almost filled up at
the back as the ascent proceeds. It is as though the larva, recognizing the impossibility
of renewing its store of fluid, were saving up the little which it possesses and spending
no <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>more than is strictly necessary to enable it to escape as quickly as possible from
its unfamiliar surroundings. This economy is so well arranged that the insect reaches
the surface at the end of ten days.

<h2 class="main">THE CICADA: THE TRANSFORMATION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exit-gate is passed and left wide open, like a hole made with a large gimlet.
For some time the larva wanders about the neighbourhood, looking for some aerial support,
a tiny bush, a tuft of thyme, a blade of grass or the twig of a shrub. It finds it,
climbs up and, head upwards, clings to it firmly with the claws of the fore-feet,
which close and do not let go again. The other legs take part in sustaining it, if
the position of the branch make this possible; if not, the two claws suffice. There
follows a moment of rest to allow the supporting arms to stiffen into an immovable
grip.
</p>
<p>First, the mesothorax splits along the middle of the back. The edges of the slit separate
slowly and reveal the pale-green colour of the insect. Almost immediately afterwards,
the prothorax splits also. The longitudinal fissure reaches the back of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>head above and the metathorax below, without spreading farther. The wrapper of the
skull breaks crosswise, in front of the eyes; and the red stemmata appear. The green
portion uncovered by these ruptures swells and protrudes over the whole of the mesothorax.
We see slow palpitations, alternate contractions and distensions due to the ebb and
flow of the blood. This hernia, working at first out of sight, is the wedge that made
the cuirass split along two crossed lines of least resistance.
</p>
<p>The skinning-operation makes rapid progress. Soon the head is free. Then the rostrum
and the front legs gradually leave their sheaths. The body is horizontal, with the
ventral surface turned upwards. Under the wide-open carapace appear the hinder legs,
the last to be released. The wings are distended with moisture. They are still rumpled
and look like stumps bent into a bow. This first phase of the transformation has taken
but ten minutes.
</p>
<p>There remains the second, which lasts longer. The whole of the insect is free, except
the tip of the abdomen, which is still contained in its scabbard. The cast skin continues
to grip the twig. Stiffening as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>result of quick desiccation, it preserves without change the attitude which it had
at the start. It forms the pivot for what is about to follow.
</p>
<p>Fixed to his slough by the tip of the abdomen, which is not yet extracted, the Cicada
turns over perpendicularly, head downwards. He is pale-green, tinged with yellow.
The wings, until now compressed into thick stumps, straighten out, unfurl, spread
under the rush of the liquid with which they are gorged. When this slow and delicate
operation is ended, the Cicada, with an almost imperceptible movement, draws himself
up by sheer strength of loin and resumes a normal position, head upwards. The fore-legs
hook on to the empty skin; and at last the tip of the belly is drawn from its sheath.
The extraction is over. The work has required half an hour altogether.
</p>
<p>Here is the whole insect, freed from its mask, but how different from what it will
be presently! The wings are heavy, moist, transparent, with their veins a light green.
The prothorax and mesothorax are barely tinged with brown. All the rest of the body
is pale-green, whitish in places. It must <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>bathe in air and sunshine for a long time before strength and colour can come to its
frail body. About two hours pass without producing any noticeable change. Hanging
to his cast skin by his fore-claws only, the Cicada sways at the least breath of air,
still feeble and still green. At last the brown tinge appears, becomes more marked
and is soon general. Half an hour has effected the change of colour. Slung from the
suspension-twig at nine o’clock in the morning, the Cicada flies away, before my eyes,
at half-past twelve.
</p>
<p>The cast skin remains, intact, save for its fissure, and so firmly fastened that the
rough weather of autumn does not always succeed in bringing it to the ground. For
some months yet, even during the winter, one often meets old skins hanging in the
bushes in the exact position adopted by the larva at the moment of its transformation.
Their horny nature, something like dry parchment, ensures a long existence for these
relics.
</p>
<p>Let us hark back for a moment to the gymnastic feat which enables the Cicada to leave
his scabbard. At first retained by the tip of the abdomen, which is the last part
to remain in its case, the Cicada turns over <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>perpendicularly, head downwards. This somersault allows him to free his wings and
legs, after the head and chest have already made their appearance by cracking the
armour under the pressure of a hernia. Now comes the time to free the end of the abdomen,
the pivot of this inverted attitude. For this purpose, the insect, with a laborious
movement of its back, draws itself up, brings its head to the top again and hooks
itself with its fore-claws to the cast skin. A fresh support is thus obtained, enabling
it to pull the tip of its abdomen from its sheath.
</p>
<p>There are therefore two means of support: first the end of the belly and then the
front claws; and there are two principal movements: in the first place the downward
somersault, in the second place the return to the normal position. These gymnastics
demand that the larva shall fix itself to a twig, head upwards, and that it shall
have a free space beneath it. Suppose that these conditions were lacking, thanks to
my wiles: what would happen? That remained to be seen.
</p>
<p>I tie a thread to the end of one of the hind-legs and hang the larva up in the peaceful
atmosphere of a test-tube. My thread <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>is a plumb-line which will remain vertical, for there is nothing to interfere with
it. In this unwonted posture, which places its head at the bottom at a time when the
near approach of the transformation demands that it should be at the top, the unfortunate
creature for a long time kicks about and struggles, striving to turn over and to seize
with its fore-claws either the thread by which it hangs or one of its own hind-legs.
Some of them succeed in their efforts, draw themselves up as best they can, fasten
themselves as they wish, despite the difficulty of keeping their balance, and effect
their metamorphosis without impediment.
</p>
<p>Others wear themselves out in vain. They do not catch hold of the thread, they do
not bring their heads upwards. Then the transformation is not accomplished. Sometimes
the dorsal rupture takes place, leaving bare the mesothorax swollen into a hernia,
but the shelling proceeds no farther and the insect soon dies. More often still the
larva perishes intact, without the least fissure.
</p>
<p>Another experiment. I place the larva in a glass jar with a thin bed of sand, which
makes progress possible. The animal moves along, but is not able to hoist itself up
anywhere: <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>the slippery sides of the glass prevent this. Under these conditions, the captive
expires without trying to transform itself. I have known exceptions to this miserable
ending; I have sometimes seen the larva undergo a regular metamorphosis on a layer
of sand thanks to peculiarities of equilibrium which were very difficult to distinguish.
In the main, when the normal attitude or something very near it is impossible, metamorphosis
does not take place and the insect succumbs. That is the general rule.
</p>
<p>This result seems to tell us that the larva is capable of opposing the forces which
are at work in it when the transformation is at hand. A cabbage-silique, a pea-pod
invariably burst to set free their seeds. The Cicada-larva, a sort of pod containing,
by way of seed, the perfect insect, is able to control its dehiscence, to defer it
until a more opportune moment and even to suppress it altogether in unfavourable circumstances.
Convulsed by the profound revolution that takes place in its body on the point of
transfiguration, but at the same time warned by instinct that the conditions are not
good, the insect makes a desperate resistance and dies rather than consent to open.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apart from the trials to which my curiosity subjects it, I do not see that the Cicada-larva
is exposed to any danger of perishing in this way. There is always a bit of brushwood
of some kind near the exit-hole. The newly-exhumed insect climbs on it; and a few
minutes are enough for the animal pod to split down the back. This swift hatching
has often been a source of trouble to me in my studies. A larva appears on the hills
not far from my house. I catch sight of it just as it is fastening on the twig. It
would form an interesting subject of observation indoors. I place it in a paper bag,
together with the stick that carries it, and hurry home. This takes me a quarter of
an hour, but it is labour lost: by the time that I arrive, the green Cicada is almost
free. I shall not see what I was bent on seeing. I had to abandon this method of obtaining
information and be content with an occasional lucky find within a few yards of my
door.
</p>
<p>“Everything is in everything,” as Jacotot the pedagogue<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1085src" href="#xd31e1085">1</a> used to say. In connection <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>with that remarkably quick metamorphosis a culinary question arises. According to
Aristotle, Cicadæ were a highly-appreciated dish among the Greeks. I am not acquainted
with the great naturalist’s text: humble villager that I am, my library possesses
no such treasure. I happen, however, to have before me a venerable tome which can
tell me just what I want to know. I refer to Matthiolus’ <i>Commentaries on Dioscorides</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1093src" href="#xd31e1093">2</a> As an eminent scholar, who must have known his Aristotle very well, Matthiolus inspires
me with complete confidence. Now he says:
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">“<i>Mirum non est quod dixerit Aristoteles, cicadas esse gustu suavissimas antequam tettigometræ
rumpatur cortex.</i>”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Knowing that <i lang="la">tettigometra</i>, or mother of the Cicada, is the expression used by the ancients to denote the larva,
we see that, according to Aristotle, the Cicadæ possess a flavour most delicious to
the taste before the bark or outer covering of the matrix bursts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>This detail of the unbroken covering tells us at what season the toothsome dainty
should be picked. It cannot be in winter, when the earth is dug deep by the plough,
for at that time there is no danger of the larva’s hatching. People do not recommend
an utterly <span class="corr" id="xd31e1113" title="Source: superflous">superfluous</span> precaution. It is therefore in summer, at the period of the emergence from underground,
when a good search will discover the larvæ, one by one, on the surface of the soil.
This is the real moment to take care that the wrapper is unbroken. It is the moment
also to hasten the gathering and the preparations for cooking: in a very few minutes
the wrapper will burst.
</p>
<p>Are the ancient culinary reputation and that appetizing epithet, <i lang="la">suavissimas gustu</i>, well-deserved? We have an excellent opportunity: let us profit by it and restore
to honour, if the occasion warrant it, the dish extolled by Aristotle. Rondelet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1121src" href="#xd31e1121">3</a> Rabelais’ erudite friend, gloried in having rediscovered <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span><i>garum</i>, the famous sauce made from the entrails of rotten fish. Would it not be a meritorious
work to give the epicures their <i lang="la">tettigometræ</i> again?
</p>
<p>On a morning in July, when the sun is up and has invited the Cicadæ to leave the ground,
the whole household, big and little, go out searching. There are five of us engaged
in exploring the enclosure, especially the edges of paths, which yield the best results.
To prevent the skin from bursting, as each larva is found I dip it into a glass of
water. Asphyxia will stay the work of metamorphosis. After two hours of careful seeking,
when every forehead is streaming with perspiration, I am the owner of four larvæ,
no more. They are dead or dying in their preserving bath; but this does not matter,
since they are destined for the frying-pan.
</p>
<p>The method of cooking is of the simplest, so as to alter as little as possible the
flavour reputed to be so exquisite: a few drops of oil, a pinch of salt, a little
onion and that is all. There is no conciser recipe in the whole of <i lang="fr">La Cuisinière bourgeoise</i>. At dinner, the fry is divided fairly among all of us hunters.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>The stuff is unanimously admitted to be eatable. True, we are people blessed with
good appetites and wholly unprejudiced stomachs. There is even a slightly shrimpy
flavour which would be found in a still more pronounced form in a <i>brochette</i> of Locusts. It is, however, as tough as the devil and anything but succulent; we
really feel as if we were chewing bits of parchment. I will not recommend to anybody
the dish extolled by Aristotle.
</p>
<p>Certainly, the renowned animal-historian was remarkably well-informed as a rule. His
royal pupil sent on his behalf to India, the land at that time so full of mystery,
for the curiosities most impressive to Macedonian eyes; he received by caravan the
Elephant, the Panther, the Tiger, the Rhinoceros, the Peacock; and he described them
faithfully. But, in Macedonia itself, he knew the insect only through the peasant,
that stubborn tiller of the soil, who found the <i lang="la">tettigometra</i> under his spade and was the first to know that a Cicada comes out of it. Aristotle,
therefore, in his immense undertaking, was doing more or less what Pliny was to do
later, with a much greater amount of artless credulity. He listened to <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>the chit-chat of the country-side and set it down as veracious history.
</p>
<p>Rustic waggery is world-famous. The countryman is always ready to jeer at the trifles
which we call science; he laughs at whoso stops to examine an insignificant insect;
he goes into fits of laughter if he sees us picking up a pebble, looking at it and
putting it in our pocket. The Greek peasant excelled in this sort of thing. He told
the townsman that the <i lang="la">tettigometra</i> was a dish fit for the gods, of an incomparable flavour, <i lang="la">suavissima gustu</i>. But, while making his victim’s mouth water with hyperbolical praises, he put it
out of his power to satisfy his longings, by laying down the essential condition that
he must gather the delicious morsel before the shell had burst.
</p>
<p>I should like to see any one try to get together the material for a sufficiently copious
dish by gathering a few handfuls of <i lang="la">tettigometræ</i> just coming out of the earth, when my squad of five took two hours to find four larvæ
on ground rich in Cicadæ. Above all, mind that the skin does not break during your
search, which will last for days and days, whereas the bursting takes place in a few
minutes. My opinion <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>is that Aristotle never tasted a fry of <i lang="la">tettigometræ</i>; and my own culinary experience is my witness. He is repeating some rustic jest in
all good faith. His heavenly dish is too horrible for words.
</p>
<p>Oh, what a fine collection of stories I too could make about the Cicada, if I listened
to all that my neighbours the peasants tell me! I will give one particular of his
history and one alone, as related in the country.
</p>
<p>Have you any renal infirmity? Are you dropsical at all? Do you need a powerful depurative?
The village pharmacopœia is unanimous in suggesting the Cicada as a sovran remedy.
The insects are collected in summer, in their adult form. They are strung together
and dried in the sun and are fondly preserved in a corner of the press. A housewife
would think herself lacking in prudence if she allowed July to pass without threading
her store of them.
</p>
<p>Do you suffer from irritation of the kidneys, or perhaps from stricture? Quick, have
some Cicada-tea! Nothing, they tell me, is so efficacious. I am duly grateful to the
good soul who once, as I have since heard, made me drink a concoction of the sort,
without my knowing it, for some <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>trouble or other; but I remain profoundly incredulous. I am struck, however, by the
fact that the same specific was recommended long ago by Dioscorides. The old Cilician
doctor tells us:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“<i lang="la">Cicadæ, quæ inassatæ manduntur, vesicæ doloribus prosunt.</i>”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1185src" href="#xd31e1185">4</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Ever since the far-off days of this patriarch of <i lang="la">materia medica</i>, the Provençal peasant has retained his faith in the remedy revealed to him by the
Greeks who brought the olive, the fig-tree and the vine from Phocæa. One thing alone
is changed: Dioscorides advises us to eat our Cicadæ roasted; nowadays they are boiled
and taken as an infusion.
</p>
<p>The explanation given of the insect’s diuretic properties is wonderfully ingenuous.
The Cicada, as all of us here know, shoots a sudden spray of urine, as it flies away,
in the face of any one who tries to take hold of it. He is therefore bound to hand
on his powers of evacuation to us. Thus must Dioscorides and his contemporaries have
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>argued; and thus does the peasant of Provence argue to this day.
</p>
<p>O my worthy friends, what would you say if you knew the virtues of the <i lang="la">tettigometra</i>, which is capable of mixing mortar with its urine to build a meteorological station
withal! You would be driven to borrow the hyperbole of Rabelais, who shows us Gargantua
seated on the towers of Notre-Dame and drowning with the deluge from his mighty bladder
so many thousand Paris loafers, not to mention the women and children!

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CICADA: HIS MUSIC</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By his own confession, Réaumur never heard the Cicada sing; he never saw the insect
alive. It reached him from the country round Avignon preserved in spirits and a goodly
supply of sugar. These conditions were enough to enable the anatomist to give an exact
description of the organ of sound; nor did the master fail to do so: his penetrating
eye clearly discerned the construction of the strange musical-box, so much so that
his treatise upon it has become the fountain-head for any one who wants to say a few
words about the Cicada’s song.
</p>
<p>With him the harvest was gathered; it but remains to glean a few ears which the disciple
hopes to make into a sheaf. I have more than enough of what Réaumur lacked: I hear
rather more of these deafening symphonists than I could wish; and so I shall perhaps
obtain a little fresh light on a subject <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>that seems exhausted. Let us therefore go back to the question of the Cicada’s song,
repeating only so much of the data acquired as may be necessary to make my explanation
clear.
</p>
<p>In my neighbourhood I can capture five species of Cicadæ, namely, <i lang="la">Cicada plebeia</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>; <i lang="la">C. orni</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>; <i lang="la">C. hematodes</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>; <i lang="la">C. atra</i>, <span class="sc">Oliv.</span>; and <i lang="la">C. pygmæa</i>, <span class="sc">Oliv.</span> The first two are extremely common; the three others are rarities, almost unknown
to the country-folk.
</p>
<p>The Common Cicada is the biggest of the five, the most popular and the one whose musical
apparatus is usually described. Under the male’s chest, immediately behind the hind-legs,
are two large semicircular plates, overlapping each other slightly, the right plate
being on the top of the left. These are the shutters, the lids, the dampers, in short
the <i>opercula</i> of the organ of sound. Lift them up. You then see opening, on either side, a roomy
cavity, known in Provence by the name of the chapel (<i lang="fr">li capello</i>). The two together form the church (<i lang="fr">la glèiso</i>). They are bounded in front by a soft, thin, creamy-yellow membrane; at the back
by a dry pellicle, iridescent as a soap-bubble <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>and called the mirror (<i lang="fr">mirau</i>) in the Provençal tongue.
</p>
<p>The church, the mirrors and the lids are commonly regarded as the sound-producing
organs. Of a singer short of breath it is said that he has cracked his mirrors (<i lang="fr">a li mirau creba</i>). Picturesque language says the same thing of an uninspired poet. Acoustics give
the lie to the popular belief. You can break the mirrors, remove the lids with a cut
of the scissors, tear the yellow front membrane and these mutilations will not do
away with the Cicada’s song: they simply modify it, weaken it slightly. The chapels
are resonators. They do not produce sound, they increase it by the vibrations of their
front and back membranes; they change it as their shutters are opened more or less
wide.
</p>
<p>The real organ of sound is seated elsewhere and is not easy to find, for a novice.
On the other side of each chapel, at the ridge joining the belly to the back, is a
slit bounded by horny walls and masked by the lowered lid. Let us call it the window.
This opening leads to a cavity or sound-chamber deeper than the adjacent chapel, but
much less wide. Immediately behind the attachment of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>rear wings is a slight, almost oval protuberance, which is distinguished by its dull-black
colour from the silvery down of the surrounding skin. This protuberance is the outer
wall of the sound-chamber.
</p>
<p>Let us make a large cut in it. We now lay bare the sound-producing apparatus, the
cymbal. This is a little dry, white membrane, oval-shaped, convex on the outside,
crossed from end to end of its longer diameter by a bundle of three or four brown
nervures, which give it elasticity, and fixed all round in a stiff frame. Imagine
this bulging scale to be pulled out of shape from within, flattening slightly and
then quickly recovering its original convexity owing to the spring of its nervures.
The drawing in and blowing out will produce a clicking sound.
</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, all Paris went mad over a silly toy called the Cricket, or <i>Cri-cri</i>, if I remember rightly. It consisted of a short blade of steel, fastened at one end
to a metallic base. Alternately pressed out of shape with the thumb and then released,
the said blade, though possessing no other merit, gave out a very irritating click;
and nothing more was needed to make it popular. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>Cricket’s vogue is over. Oblivion has done justice to it so drastically that I doubt
if I shall be understood when I recall the once famous apparatus.
</p>
<p>The membranous cymbal and steel Cricket are similar instruments. Both are made to
rattle by pushing an elastic blade out of shape and restoring it to its original condition.
The Cricket was bent out of shape with the thumb. How is the convexity of the cymbals
modified? Let us go back to the church and break the yellow curtain that marks the
boundary of each chapel in front. Two thick muscular columns come in sight, of a pale
orange colour, joined together in the form of a V, with its point standing on the
insect’s median line, on the lower surface. Each of these fleshy columns ends abruptly
at the top, as though lopped off; and from the truncated stump rises a short, slender
cord which is fastened to the side of the corresponding cymbal.
</p>
<p>There you have the whole mechanism, which is no less simple than that of the metal
Cricket. The two muscular columns contract and relax, shorten and lengthen. By means
of the terminal thread each tugs at its cymbal, pulling it down and forthwith letting
<span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>it spring back of itself. Thus are the two sound-plates made to vibrate.
</p>
<p>Would you convince yourself of the efficacy of this mechanism? Would you make a dead
but still fresh Cicada sing? Nothing could be simpler. Seize one of the muscular columns
with the pincers and jerk it gently. The dead <i>Cri-cri</i> comes to life again; each jerk produces the clash of the cymbal. The sound is very
feeble, I admit, deprived of the fulness which the living virtuoso obtains with the
aid of his sound-chambers; nevertheless the fundamental element of the song is produced
by this anatomical trick.
</p>
<p>Would you on the other hand silence a live Cicada, that obstinate melomaniac who,
when you hold him prisoner in your fingers, bewails his sad lot as garrulously as,
just now, he sang his joys in the tree? It is no use to break open his chapels, to
crack his mirrors: the shameful mutilation would not check him. But insert a pin through
the side slit which we have called the window and touch the cymbal at the bottom of
the sound-chamber. A tiny prick; and the perforated cymbal is silent. A similar operation
on the other side renders the insect mute, though it remains as vigorous as before,
showing <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>no perceptible wound. Any one unacquainted with the method of procedure stands amazed
at the result of my pin-prick, when the utter destruction of the mirrors and the other
accessories of the church does not produce silence. A tiny and in no way serious stab
has an effect which is not caused even by evisceration.
</p>
<p>The lids, those firmly fitted plates, are stationary. It is the abdomen itself which,
by rising and falling, causes the church to open and shut. When the abdomen is lowered,
the lids cover the chapels exactly, together with the windows of the sound-chambers.
The sound is then weakened, muffled, stifled. When the abdomen rises, the chapels
open, the windows are unobstructed and the sound acquires its full strength. The rapid
oscillations of the belly, therefore, synchronizing with the contractions of the motor-muscles
of the cymbals, determine the varying volume of the sound, which seems to come from
hurried strokes of a bow.
</p>
<p>When the weather is calm and warm, about the middle of the day, the Cicada’s song
is divided into strophes of a few seconds’ duration, separated by short pauses. <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>The strophe begins abruptly. In a rapid crescendo, the abdomen oscillating faster
and faster, it acquires its maximum volume; it keeps up the same degree of strength
for a few seconds and then becomes gradually weaker and degenerates into a tremolo
which decreases as the belly relapses into rest. With the last pulsations of the abdomen
comes silence, which lasts for a longer or shorter time according to the condition
of the atmosphere. Then suddenly we hear a new strophe, a monotonous repetition of
the first; and so on indefinitely.
</p>
<p>It often happens, especially during the sultry evening hours, that the insect, drunk
with sunshine, shortens and even entirely suppresses the pauses. The song is then
continuous, but always with alternations of <i>crescendo</i> and <i>decrescendo</i>. The first strokes of the bow are given at about seven or eight o’clock in the morning;
and the orchestra ceases only with the dying gleams of the twilight, at about eight
o’clock in the evening. Altogether the concert lasts the whole round of the clock.
But, if the sky be overcast, if the wind blow cold, the Cicada is dumb.
</p>
<p>The second species is only half the size <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>of the Common Cicada and is known in the district by the name of the <i>Cacan</i>, a fairly accurate imitation of his peculiar rattle. This is the Ash Cicada of the
naturalists; and he is far more alert and more suspicious than the first. His harsh
loud song consists of a series of <i>Can! Can! Can! Can!</i> with not a pause to divide the ode into strophes. Its monotony and its harsh shrillness
make it a most unpleasant ditty, especially when the orchestra is composed of some
hundreds of executants, as happens in my two plane-trees during the dog-days. At such
times it is as though a heap of dry walnuts were being shaken in a bag until the shells
cracked. This irritating concert, a veritable torment, has only one slight advantage
about it: the Ash Cicada does not start quite so early in the morning as the Common
Cicada and does not sit up so late at night.
</p>
<p>Although constructed on the same fundamental principles, the vocal apparatus displays
numerous peculiarities which give the song its special character. The sound-chamber
is entirely lacking, which means that there is no entrance-window either. The cymbal
is uncovered, just behind the insertion of the hind-wing. It again is a dry, white
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>scale, convex on the outside and crossed by a bundle of five red-brown nervures.
</p>
<p>The first segment of the abdomen thrusts forward a short, wide tongue, which is quite
rigid and of which the free end rests on the cymbal. This tongue may be compared with
the blade of a rattle which, instead of fitting into the teeth of a revolving wheel,
touches the nervures of the vibrating cymbal more or less closely. The harsh, grating
sound must, I think, be partly due to this. It is hardly possible to verify the fact
when holding the creature in our fingers: the startled <i>Cacan</i> does anything at such times rather than emit his normal song.
</p>
<p>The lids do not overlap; on the contrary, they are separated by a rather wide interval.
With the rigid tongues, those appendages of the abdomen, they shelter one half of
the cymbals, the other half of which is quite bare. The abdomen, when pressed with
the finger, does not open to any great extent where it joins the thorax. For the rest,
the insect keeps still when it sings; it knows nothing of the rapid quivering of the
belly that modulates the song of the Common Cicada. The chapels are very small and
almost negligible as sounding-boards. There <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>are mirrors, it is true, but insignificant ones, measuring scarcely a twenty-fifth
of an inch. In short, the mechanism of sound, which is so highly developed in the
Common Cicada, is very rudimentary here. How then does the thin clash of the cymbals
manage to gain in volume until it becomes intolerable?
</p>
<p>The Ash Cicada is a ventriloquist. If we examine the abdomen by holding it up to the
light, we see that the front two thirds are translucent. Let us snip off the opaque
third part that retains, reduced to the strictly indispensable, the organs essential
to the propagation of the species and the preservation of the individual. The rest
of the belly is wide open and presents a spacious cavity, with nothing but its tegumentary
walls, except in the case of the dorsal surface, which is lined with a thin layer
of muscle and serves as a support to the slender digestive tube, which is little more
than a thread. The large receptacle, forming nearly half of the insect’s total bulk,
is therefore empty, or nearly so. At the back are seen the two motor pillars of the
cymbals, the two muscular columns arranged in a V. To the right and left of the point
of this V gleam the two tiny mirrors; and the empty space is <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>continued between the two branches into the depths of the thorax.
</p>
<p>This hollow belly and its thoracic complement form an enormous resonator, unapproached
by that of any other performer in our district. If I close with my finger the orifice
in the abdomen which I have just clipped, the sound becomes lower, in conformity with
the laws affecting organ-pipes; if I fit a cylinder, a screw of paper, to the mouth
of the open belly, the sound becomes louder as well as deeper. With a paper funnel
properly adjusted, its wide end thrust into the mouth of a test-tube acting as a sounding-board,
we have no longer the shrilling of the Cicada but something very near the bellowing
of a Bull. My small children, happening to be there at the moment when I am making
my acoustic experiments, run away scared. The familiar insect inspires them with terror.
</p>
<p>The harshness of the sound appears to be due to the tongue of the rattle rasping the
nervures of the vibrating cymbals; its intensity may no doubt be ascribed to the spacious
sounding-board of the belly. Assuredly one must be passionately enamoured of song
thus to empty one’s belly and chest in order <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>to make room for a musical-box. The essential vital organs are reduced to the minimum,
are confined to a tiny corner, so as to leave a greater space for the sounding-cavity.
Song comes first; all the rest takes second place.
</p>
<p>It is a good thing that the Ash Cicada does not follow the teaching of the evolutionists.
If, becoming more enthusiastic from generation to generation, he were able by progressive
stages to acquire a ventral sounding-board fit to compare with that which my paper
screws give him, my Provence, peopled as it is with <i>Cacans</i>, would one day become uninhabitable.
</p>
<p>After the details which I have already given concerning the Common Cicada, it seems
hardly necessary to say how the insupportable chatterbox of the Ash is rendered dumb.
The cymbals are clearly visible on the outside. You prick them with the point of a
needle. Complete silence follows instantly. Why are there not in my plane-trees, among
the dagger-wearing insects, auxiliaries who, like myself, love quiet and who would
devote themselves to that task! A mad wish! A note would then be lacking in the majestic
harvest symphony.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Red Cicada (<i lang="la">C. hematodes</i>) is a little smaller than the Common Cicada. He owes his name to the blood-red colour
that takes the place of the other’s brown on the veins of the wings and some other
lineaments of the body. He is rare. I come upon him occasionally in the hawthorn-bushes.
As regards his musical apparatus, he stands half-way between the Common Cicada and
the Ash Cicada. He has the former’s oscillation of the belly, which increases or reduces
the strength of the sound by opening or closing the church; he possesses the latter’s
exposed cymbals, unaccompanied by any sound-chamber or window.
</p>
<p>The cymbals therefore are bare, immediately after the attachment of the hind-wings.
They are white, fairly regular in their convexity and boast eight long, parallel nervures
of a ruddy brown and seven others which are much shorter and which are inserted singly
in the intervals between the first. The lids are small and scolloped at their inner
edge so as to cover only half of the corresponding chapel. The opening left by the
hollow in the lid has as a shutter a little pallet fixed to the base of the hind-leg,
which, by folding itself against the body or lifting slightly, <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>keeps the aperture either shut or open. The other Cicadæ have each a similar appendage,
but in their case it is narrower and more pointed.
</p>
<p>Moreover, as with the Common Cicada, the belly moves freely up and down. This heaving
movement, combined with the play of the femoral pallets, opens and closes the chapels
to varying extents.
</p>
<p>The mirrors, though not so large as the Common Cicada’s, have the same appearance.
The membrane that faces them on the thorax side is white, oval and very delicate and
is tight-stretched when the abdomen is raised and flabby and wrinkled when the abdomen
is lowered. In its tense state it seems capable of vibration and of increasing the
sound.
</p>
<p>The song, modulated and subdivided into strophes, suggests that of the Common Cicada,
but is much less objectionable. Its lack of shrillness may well be due to the absence
of any sound-chambers. Other things being equal, cymbals vibrating uncovered cannot
possess the same intensity of sound as those vibrating at the far end of an echoing
vestibule. The noisy Ash Cicada also, it is true, lacks that vestibule; but he <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>amply makes up for its absence by the enormous resonator of his belly.
</p>
<p>I have never seen the third Cicada, sketched by Réaumur and described by Olivier<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1356src" href="#xd31e1356">1</a> under the name of <i lang="la">C. tomentosa</i>. The species is known in Provence, so this and that one tells me, by the name of
the <i>Cigalon</i>, or rather <i>Cigaloun</i>, the Little Cigale or Cicada. This designation is unknown in my neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>I possess two other specimens which Réaumur probably confused with the one of which
he gives us a drawing. One is the Black Cicada (<i lang="la">C. atra</i>, <span class="sc">Oliv.</span>), whom I came across only once; the other is the Pigmy Cicada (<i lang="la">C. pygmæa</i>, <span class="sc">Oliv.</span>), whom I have picked up pretty often. I will say a few words about this last one.
</p>
<p>He is the smallest member of the genus in my district, the size of an average Gad-fly,
and measures about three-quarters of an inch in length. His cymbals are transparent,
with three opaque veins, are scarcely sheltered by <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>a fold in the skin and are in full view, without any sort of entrance-lobby or sound-chamber.
I may remark, in terminating our survey, that the entrance-lobby exists only in the
Common Cicada; all the others are without it.
</p>
<p>The dampers are separated by a wide interval and allow the chapels to open wide. The
mirrors are comparatively large. Their shape suggests the outline of a kidney-bean.
The abdomen does not heave when the insect sings; it remains stationary, like the
Ash Cicada’s. Hence a lack of variety in the melody of both.
</p>
<p>The Pigmy Cicada’s song is a monotonous rattle, pitched in a shrill key, but faint
and hardly perceptible a few steps away in the calm of our enervating July afternoons.
If ever a fancy seized him to forsake his sun-scorched bushes and to come and settle
down in force in my cool plane-trees—and I wish that he would, for I should much like
to study him more closely—this pretty little Cicada would not disturb my solitude
as the frenzied <i>Cacan</i> does.
</p>
<p>We have now ploughed our way through the descriptive part; we know the instrument
of sound so far as its structure is concerned. <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>In conclusion, let us ask ourselves the object of these musical orgies. What is the
use of all this noise? One reply is bound to come: it is the call of the males summoning
their mates; it is the lovers’ cantata.
</p>
<p>I will allow myself to discuss this answer, which is certainly a very natural one.
For fifteen years the Common Cicada and his shrill associate, the <i>Cacan</i>, have thrust their society upon me. Every summer for two months I have them before
my eyes, I have them in my ears. Though I may not listen to them gladly, I observe
them with a certain zeal. I see them ranged in rows on the smooth bark of the plane-trees,
all with their heads upwards, both sexes interspersed with a few inches between them.
</p>
<p>With their suckers driven into the tree, they drink, motionless. As the sun turns
and moves the shadow, they also turn around the branch with slow lateral steps and
make for the best-lighted and hottest surface. Whether they be working their suckers
or moving their quarters, they never cease singing.
</p>
<p>Are we to take the endless cantilena for a passionate call? I am not sure. In the
assembly the two sexes are side by side; and <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>you do not spend months on end in calling to some one who is at your elbow. Then again,
I never see a female come rushing into the midst of the very noisiest orchestra. Sight
is enough as a prelude to marriage here, for it is excellent; the wooer has no use
for an everlasting declaration: the wooed is his next-door neighbour.
</p>
<p>Could it be a means then of charming, of touching the indifferent one? I still have
my doubts. I notice no signs of satisfaction in the females; I do not see them give
the least flutter nor sway from side to side, though the lovers clash their cymbals
never so loudly.
</p>
<p>My neighbours the peasants say that, at harvest-time, the Cicada sings, “<i>Sego, sego, sego!</i> Reap, reap, reap!” to encourage them to work. Whether harvesters of wheat or harvesters
of thought, we follow the same occupation, one for the bread of the stomach, the other
for the bread of the mind. I can understand their explanation, therefore; and I accept
it as an instance of charming simplicity.
</p>
<p>Science asks for something better; but she finds in the insect a world that is closed
to us. There is no possibility of divining or even <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>suspecting the impression produced by the clash of the cymbals upon those who inspire
it. All that I can say is that their impassive exterior seems to denote complete indifference.
Let us not insist too much: the private feelings of animals are an unfathomable mystery.
</p>
<p>Another reason for doubt is this: those who are sensitive to music always have delicate
hearing; and this hearing, a watchful sentinel, should give warning of any danger
at the least sound. The birds, those skilled songsters, have an exquisitely fine sense
of hearing. Should a leaf stir in the branches, should two wayfarers exchange a word,
they will be suddenly silent, anxious, on their guard. How far the Cicada is from
such sensibility!
</p>
<p>He has very clear sight. His large faceted eyes inform him of what happens on the
right and what happens on the left; his three stemmata, like little ruby telescopes,
explore the expanse above his head. The moment he sees us coming, he is silent and
flies away. But place yourself behind the branch on which he is singing, arrange so
that you are not within reach of the five visual organs; and then talk, whistle, clap
<span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>your hands, knock two stones together. For much less than this, a bird, though it
would not see you, would interrupt its singing and fly away terrified. The imperturbable
Cicada goes on rattling as though nothing were afoot.
</p>
<p>Of my experiments in this matter, I will mention only one, the most memorable. I borrow
the municipal artillery, that is to say, the mortars which are made to thunder forth
on the feast of the patron-saint. The gunner is delighted to load them for the benefit
of the Cicadæ and to come and fire them off at my place. There are two of them, crammed
as though for the most solemn rejoicings. No politician making the circuit of his
constituency in search of re-election was ever honoured with so much powder. We are
careful to leave the windows open, to save the panes from breaking. The two thundering
engines are set at the foot of the plane-trees in front of my door. No precautions
are taken to mask them: the Cicadæ singing in the branches overhead cannot see what
is happening below.
</p>
<p>We are an audience of six. We wait for a moment of comparative quiet. The number <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>of singers is checked by each of us, as are the depth and rhythm of the song. We are
now ready, with ears pricked up to hear what will happen in the aerial orchestra.
The mortar is let off, with a noise like a genuine thunder-clap.
</p>
<p>There is no excitement whatever up above. The number of executants is the same, the
rhythm is the same, the volume of sound the same. The six witnesses are unanimous:
the mighty explosion has in no way affected the song of the Cicadæ. And the second
mortar gives an exactly similar result.
</p>
<p>What conclusion are we to draw from this persistence of the orchestra, which is not
at all surprised or put out by the firing of a gun? Am I to infer from it that the
Cicada is deaf? I will certainly not venture so far as that; but, if any one else,
more daring than I, were to make the assertion, I should really not know what arguments
to employ in contradicting him. I should be obliged at least to concede that the Cicada
is extremely hard of hearing and that we may apply to him the familiar saying, to
bawl like a deaf man.
</p>
<p>When the Blue-winged Locust takes his luxurious fill of sunshine on a gravelly path
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>and with his great hind-shanks rubs the rough edge of his wing-cases; when the Green
Tree-frog, suffering from as chronic a cold as the <i>Cacan</i>, swells his throat among the leaves and distends it into a resounding bladder at
the approach of a storm, are they both calling to their absent mates? By no means.
The bow-strokes of the first produce hardly a perceptible stridulation; the throaty
exuberance of the second is no more effective: the object of their desire does not
come.
</p>
<p>Does the insect need these sonorous outbursts, these loquacious avowals, to declare
its flame? Consult the vast majority, whom the meeting of the two sexes leaves silent.
I see in the Grasshopper’s fiddle, the Tree-frog’s bagpipes and the cymbals of the
<i>Cacan</i> but so many methods of expressing the joy of living, the universal joy which every
animal species celebrates after its kind.
</p>
<p>If any one were to tell me that the Cicadæ strum on their noisy instruments without
giving a thought to the sound produced and for the sheer pleasure of feeling themselves
alive, just as we rub our hands in a moment of satisfaction, I should not be greatly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>shocked. That there may be also a secondary object in their concert, an object in
which the dumb sex is interested, is quite possible, quite natural, though this has
not yet been proved.

<h2 class="main">THE CICADA: THE LAYING AND THE HATCHING OF THE EGGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Common Cicada entrusts her eggs to small dry branches. All those which Réaumur
examined and found to be thus tenanted were derived from the mulberry-tree: a proof
that the person commissioned to collect these eggs in the Avignon district was very
conservative in his methods of search. In addition to the mulberry-tree, I, on the
other hand, find them on the peach, the cherry, the willow, the Japanese privet and
other trees. But these are exceptions. The Cicada really favours something different.
She wants, as far as possible, tiny stalks, which may be anything from the thickness
of a straw to that of a lead-pencil, with a thin ring of wood and plenty of pith.
So long as these conditions are fulfilled, the actual plant matters little. I should
have to draw up a list of all the semiligneous flora <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>of the district were I to try and catalogue the different supports used by the Cicada
when laying her eggs. I shall content myself with naming a few of them in a note,
to show the variety of sites of which she avails herself.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1459src" href="#xd31e1459">1</a>
</p>
<p>The sprig occupied is never lying on the ground; it is in a position more or less
akin to the perpendicular, most often in its natural place, sometimes detached, but
in that case sticking upright by accident. Preference is given to a good long stretch
of smooth, even stalk, capable of accommodating the entire laying. My best harvests
are made on the sprigs of <i lang="la">Spartium junceum</i>, which are like straws crammed with pith, and especially on the tall stalks of <i lang="la">Asphodelus cerasiferus</i>, which rise for nearly three feet before spreading into branches.
</p>
<p>The rule is for the support, no matter what it is, to be dead and quite dry. Nevertheless
my notes record a few instances of <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>eggs confided to stalks that are still alive, with green leaves and flowers in bloom.
It is true that, in these highly exceptional cases, the stalk itself is of a pretty
dry variety.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1500src" href="#xd31e1500">2</a>
</p>
<p>The work performed by the Cicada consists of a series of pricks such as might be made
with a pin if it were driven downwards on a slant and made to tear the ligneous fibres
and force them up slightly. Any one seeing these dots without knowing what produced
them would think first of some cryptogamous vegetation, some Sphæriacea swelling and
bursting its skin under the growth of its half-emerging perithecia.
</p>
<p>If the stalk be uneven, or if several Cicadæ have been working one after the other
at the same spot, the distribution of the punctures becomes confused and the eye is
apt to wander among them, unable to perceive either the order in which they were made
or the work of each individual. One characteristic is never missing, that is the slanting
direction of the woody strip ploughed up, which shows that the Cicada always works
in an upright position and drives her implement <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>downwards into the twig, in a longitudinal direction.
</p>
<p>If the stalk be smooth and even and also of a suitable length, the punctures are nearly
equidistant and are not far from being in a straight line. Their number varies: it
is small when the mother is disturbed in her operation and goes off to continue her
laying elsewhere; it amounts to thirty or forty when the line of dots represents the
total amount of eggs laid. The actual length of the row for the same number of thrusts
likewise varies. A few examples will enlighten us in this respect: a row of thirty
measures 28 centimetres<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1516src" href="#xd31e1516">3</a> on the toad-flax, 30<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1520src" href="#xd31e1520">4</a> on the gum-succory and only 12<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1524src" href="#xd31e1524">5</a> on the asphodel.
</p>
<p>Do not imagine that these variations in length have to do with the nature of the support:
there are plenty of instances that prove the contrary; and the asphodel, which in
one case shows us the punctures that are closest together, will in other cases show
us those which are farthest removed. The distance between the dots depends on circumstances
which cannot be explained, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>especially on the caprice of the mother, who concentrates her laying more at one spot
and less at another according to her fancy. I have found the average measurement between
one hole and the next to be 8 to 10 millimetres.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1532src" href="#xd31e1532">6</a>
</p>
<p>Each of these abrasions is the entrance to a slanting cell, usually bored in the pithy
portion of the stalk. This entrance is not closed, save by the bunch of ligneous fibres
which are parted at the time of the laying but which come together again when the
double saw of the ovipositor is withdrawn. At most, in certain cases, but not always,
you see gleaming through the threads of this barricade a tiny glistening speck, looking
like a glaze of dried albumen. This can be only an insignificant trace of some albuminous
secretion which accompanies the eggs or else facilitates the play of the double boring-file.
</p>
<p>Just under the prick lies the cell, a very narrow passage which occupies almost the
entire distance between its pin-hole and that of the preceding cell. Sometimes even
there is no partition separating the two; the upper floor runs into the lower; and
the eggs, though inserted through several entrances, <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>are arranged in an uninterrupted row. Usually, however, the cells are distinct.
</p>
<p>Their contents vary greatly. I count from six to fifteen eggs in each. The average
is ten. As the number of cells of a complete laying is between thirty and forty, we
see that the Cicada disposes of three to four hundred eggs. Réaumur arrived at the
same figures from his examination of the ovaries.
</p>
<p>A fine family truly, capable by sheer numbers of coping with very grave risks of destruction.
Yet I do not see that the adult Cicada is in greater danger than any other insect:
he has a vigilant eye, can get started quickly, is a rapid flyer and inhabits heights
at which the cut-throats of the meadows are not to be feared. The Sparrow, it is true,
is very fond of him. From time to time, after careful strategy, the enemy swoops upon
the plane-trees from the neighbouring roof and grabs the frenzied fiddler. A few pecks
distributed right and left cut him up into quarters, which form delicious morsels
for the nestlings. But how often does not the bird return with an empty bag! The wary
Cicada sees the attack coming, empties his bladder into his assailant’s eyes and decamps.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>No, it is not the Sparrow that makes it necessary for the Cicada to give birth to
so numerous a progeny. The danger lies elsewhere. We shall see how terrible it can
be at hatching- and also at laying-time.
</p>
<p>Two or three weeks after the emergence from the ground, that is to say, about the
middle of July, the Cicada busies herself with her eggs. In order to witness the laying
without trusting too much to luck, I had taken certain precautions which seemed to
me to assure success. The insect’s favourite support is the dry asphodel: I had learnt
that from earlier observations. This plant is also the one that lends itself best
to my plans, owing to its long, smooth stalk. Now, during the first years of my residence
here, I replaced the thistles in my enclosure by other native plants, of a less forbidding
character. The asphodel is among the new occupants and is just what I want to-day.
I therefore leave last year’s dry stalks where they are; and, when the proper season
comes, I inspect them daily.
</p>
<p>I have not long to wait. As early as the 15th of July, I find as many Cicadæ as I
could wish installed on the asphodels, busily laying. The mother is always alone.
Each <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>has a stalk to herself, without fear of any competition that might disturb the delicate
process of inoculation. When the first occupant is gone, another may come, followed
by others yet. There is ample room for all; but each in succession wishes to be alone.
For the rest, there is no quarrelling among them; things happen most peacefully. If
some mother appears and finds the place already taken, she flies away so soon as she
discovers her mistake and looks around elsewhere.
</p>
<p>The Cicada, when laying, always carries her head upwards, an attitude which, for that
matter, she adopts in other circumstances. She lets you examine her quite closely,
even under the magnifying-glass, so greatly absorbed is she in her task. The ovipositor,
which is about two-fifths of an inch long, is buried in the stalk, slantwise. So perfect
is the tool that the boring does not seem to call for very laborious operations. I
see the mother give a jerk or two and dilate and contract the tip of her abdomen with
frequent palpitations. That is all. The drill with its double gimlets working alternately
digs and disappears into the wood, with a gentle and almost imperceptible movement.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>Nothing particular happens during the laying. The insect is motionless. Ten minutes
or so elapse between the first bite of the tool and the complete filling of the cell.
</p>
<p>The ovipositor is then withdrawn with deliberate slowness, so as not to warp it. The
boring-hole closes of itself, as the ligneous fibres come together again, and the
insect climbs a little higher, about as far as the length of its instrument, in a
straight line. Here we see a new punch of the gimlet and a new chamber receiving its
half-a-score of eggs. In this fashion the laying works its way up from bottom to top.
</p>
<p>Once we know these facts, we are in a position to understand the remarkable arrangement
controlling the work. The punctures, the entrances to the cells, are almost equidistant,
because each time the Cicada ascends about the same height, roughly the length of
her ovipositor. Very rapid in flight, she is a very lazy walker. All that you ever
see her do on the live branch on which she drinks is to move to a sunnier spot close
by, with a grave and almost solemn step. On the dead branch where the eggs are laid
she retains her leisurely habits, even exaggerating them, in view of the importance
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>the operation. She moves as little as need be, shifting her place only just enough
to avoid letting two adjoining cells encroach upon each other. The measure of the
upward movement is provided approximately by the length of the bore.
</p>
<p>Also the holes are arranged in a straight line when their number is not great. Why
indeed should the laying mother veer to the left or right on a stalk which has the
same qualities all over? Loving the sun, she has selected the side of the stalk that
is most exposed to it. So long as she feels on her back a douche of heat, her supreme
joy, she will take good care not to leave the situation which she considers so delightful
for another upon which the sun’s rays do not fall so directly.
</p>
<p>But the laying takes a long time when it is all performed on the same support. Allowing
ten minutes to a cell, the series of forty which I have sometimes seen represents
a period of six to seven hours. The sun therefore can alter its position considerably
before the Cicada has finished her work. In that case the rectilinear direction becomes
bent into a spiral curve. The mother turns around her stalk as the sun itself turns;
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>her row of pricks suggests the course of the gnomon’s shadow on a cylindrical sundial.
</p>
<p>Very often, while the Cicada is absorbed in her work of motherhood, an infinitesimal
Gnat, herself the bearer of a boring-tool, labours to exterminate the eggs as fast
as they are placed. Réaumur knew her. In nearly every bit of stick that he examined
he found her grub, which caused him to make a mistake at the beginning of his researches.
But he did not see, he could not see the impudent ravager at work. It is a Chalcidid
some four to five millimetres<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1568src" href="#xd31e1568">7</a> in length, all black, with knotty antennæ, thickening a little towards their tips.
The unsheathed boring-tool is planted in the under part of the abdomen, near the middle,
and sticks out at right angles to the body, as in the case of the Leucospes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1572src" href="#xd31e1572">8</a> the scourge of certain members of the Bee-tribe. Having neglected to capture the
insect, I do not know what name the nomenclators have bestowed upon it, if indeed
the dwarf that exterminates Cicadæ has been catalogued at all.
</p>
<p>What I do know something about is its <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>calm temerity, its brazen audacity in the immediate presence of the colossus who could
crush it by simply stepping on it. I have seen as many as three exploiting the unhappy
mother at the same time. They keep close behind each other, either working their probes
or awaiting the propitious moment.
</p>
<p>The Cicada has just stocked a cell and is climbing a little higher to bore the next.
One of the brigands runs to the abandoned spot; and here, almost under the claws of
the giantess, without the least fear, as though she were at home and accomplishing
a meritorious act, she unsheathes her probe and inserts it into the column of eggs,
not through the hole already made, which bristles with broken fibres, but through
some lateral crevice. The tool works slowly, because of the resistance of the wood,
which is almost intact. The Cicada has time to stock the next floor above.
</p>
<p>As soon as she has finished, a Gnat standing immediately behind her, waiting to perform
her task, takes her place and comes and introduces her own exterminating germ. By
the time that the mother has exhausted her ovaries and flies away, most of her cells
have, in this fashion, received the alien egg which <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>will be the ruin of their contents. A small, quick-hatching grub, one only to each
chamber, generously fed on a round dozen raw eggs, will take the place of the Cicada’s
family.
</p>
<p>O deplorable mother, have centuries of experience taught you nothing? Surely, with
those excellent eyes of yours, you cannot fail to see the terrible sappers, when they
flutter around you, preparing their felon stroke! You see them, you know that they
are at your heels; and you remain impassive and let yourself be victimized. Turn round,
you easy-going colossus, and crush the pigmies! But you will do nothing of the sort:
you are incapable of altering your instincts, even to lighten your share of maternal
sorrow.
</p>
<p>The Common Cicada’s eggs are of a gleaming ivory-white. Elongated in shape and conical
at both ends, they might be compared with miniature weavers’-shuttles. They are two
millimetres and a half long by half a millimetre wide.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1591src" href="#xd31e1591">9</a> They are arranged in a row, slightly overlapping. The Ash Cicada’s, which are a trifle
smaller, are packed in regular parcels mimicking microscopic bundles of cigars. We
will devote <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>our attention exclusively to the first; their story will tell us that of the others.
</p>
<p>September is not over before the gleaming ivory-white gives place to straw-colour.
In the early days of October there appear, in the front part, two little dark-brown
spots, round and clearly-defined, which are the ocular specks of the tiny creature
in course of formation. These two shining eyes, which almost look at you, combined
with the cone-shaped fore-end, give the eggs an appearance of finless fishes, the
very tiniest of fishes, for which a walnut-shell would make a suitable bowl.
</p>
<p>About the same period, I often see on my asphodels and those on the hills around indications
of a recent hatching. These indications take the form of certain discarded clothes,
certain rags left on the threshold by the new-born grubs moving their quarters and
eager to reach a new lodging. We shall learn in an instant what these cast skins mean.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of my visits, which were assiduous enough to deserve a better
result, I have never succeeded in seeing the young Cicadæ come out of their cells.
My home breeding prospers no better. For two <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>years running, at the right time, I collect in boxes, tubes and jars a hundred twigs
of all sorts colonized with Cicada-eggs; not one of them shows me what I am so anxious
to see, the emergence of the budding Cicadæ.
</p>
<p>Réaumur experienced the same disappointment. He tells us how all the eggs sent by
his friends proved failures, even when he carried them in a glass tube in his fob
to give them a mild temperature. O my revered master, neither the warm shelter of
our studies nor the niggardly heating-apparatus of our breeches is enough in this
case! What is needed is that supreme stimulant, the kisses of the sun; what is needed,
after the morning coolness, which already is sharp enough to make us shiver, is the
sudden glow of a glorious autumn day, summer’s last farewell.
</p>
<p>It was in such circumstances as these, when a bright sun supplied a violent contrast
to a cold night, that I used to find signs of hatching; but I always came too late:
the young Cicadæ were gone. At most I sometimes happened to find one hanging by a
thread from his native stalk and struggling in mid-air. I thought him caught in some
shred of cobweb.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last, on the 27th of October, despairing of success, I gathered the asphodels in
the enclosure and, taking the armful of dry stalks on which the Cicada had laid, carried
it up to my study. Before abandoning all hope, I proposed once more to examine the
cells and their contents. It was a cold morning. The first fire of the season had
been lit. I put my little bundle on a chair in front the hearth, without any intention
of trying the effect of the hot flames upon the nests. The sticks which I meant to
split open one by one were within easier reach of my hand there. That was the only
consideration which made me choose that particular spot.
</p>
<p>Well, while I was passing my magnifying-glass over a split stem, the hatching which
I no longer hoped to see suddenly took place beside me. My bundle became alive; the
young larvæ emerged from their cells by the dozen. Their number was so great that
my professional instincts were amply satisfied. The eggs were exactly ripe; and the
blaze on the hearth, bright and penetrating, produced the same effect as sunlight
out of doors. I lost no time in profiting by this unexpected stroke of luck.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the aperture of the egg-chamber, among the torn fibres, a tiny cone-shaped body
appears, with two large black eye-spots. To look at, it is absolutely the fore-part
of the egg, which, as I have said, resembles the front of a very minute fish. One
would think that the egg had changed its position, climbing from the bottom of the
basin to the orifice of the little passage. But an egg to move! A germ to start walking!
Such a thing was impossible, had never been known; I must be suffering from an illusion.
I split open the stalk; and the mystery is revealed. The real eggs, though a little
disarranged, have not changed their position. They are empty, reduced to transparent
bags, torn considerably at their fore-ends. From them has issued the very singular
organism whose salient characteristics I will now set forth.
</p>
<p>In its general shape, the configuration of the head and the large black eyes, the
creature, even more than the egg, presents the appearance of an extremely small fish.
A mock ventral fin accentuates the likeness. This sort of oar comes from the fore-legs,
which, cased in a special sheath, lie backwards, stretched against each other in a
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>straight line. Its feeble power of movement must help the grub to come out of the
egg-shell and—a more difficult matter—out of the fibrous passage. Withdrawing a little
way from the body and then returning, this lever provides a purchase for progression
by means of the terminal claws, which are already well-developed. The four other legs
are still wrapped in the common envelope and are absolutely inert. This applies also
to the antennæ, which can hardly be perceived through the lens. Altogether, the organism
newly issued from the egg is an exceedingly small, boat-shaped body, with a single
oar pointing backwards on the ventral surface and formed of the two fore-legs joined
together. The segmentation is very clearly marked, especially on the abdomen. Lastly,
the whole thing is quite smooth, with not a hair on it.
</p>
<p>What name shall I give to this initial state of the Cicada, a state so strange and
unforeseen and hitherto unsuspected? Must I knock Greek words together and fashion
some uncouth expression? I shall do nothing of the sort, convinced as I am that barbarous
terms are only a cumbrous impediment to science. I shall simply call it “the primary
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>larva,” as I did in the case of the Oil-beetles, the Leucospes and the Anthrax.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1622src" href="#xd31e1622">10</a>
</p>
<p>The form of the primary larva in the Cicadæ is eminently well-suited for the emergence.
The passage in which the egg is hatched is very narrow and leaves just room for one
to go out. Besides, the eggs are arranged in a row, not end to end, but partly overlapping.
The creature coming from the farther ranks has to make its way through the remains
of the eggs already hatched in front of it. To the narrowness of the corridor is added
the block caused by the empty shells.
</p>
<p>In these conditions, the larva in the form which it will have presently, when it has
torn its temporary scabbard, would not be able to clear the difficult pass. Irksome
antennæ, long legs spreading far from the axis of the body, picks with curved and
pointed ends that catch on the road: all these are in the way of a speedy deliverance.
The eggs in one cell hatch almost simultaneously. It is necessary that the new-born
grubs in front should move out as fast as they can and make <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>room for those behind. This necessitates the smooth, boatlike form, devoid of all
projections, which makes its way insinuatingly, like a wedge. The primary larva, with
its different appendages closely fixed to its body inside a common sheath, with its
boat shape and its single oar possessing a certain power of movement, has its part
to play: its business is to emerge into daylight through a difficult passage.
</p>
<p>Its task is soon done. Here comes one of the emigrants, showing its head with the
great eyes and lifting the broken fibres of the aperture. It works its way farther
and farther out, with a progressive movement so slow that the lens does not easily
perceive it. In half an hour at soonest, the boat-shaped object appears entirely;
but it is still caught by its hinder end in the exit-hole.
</p>
<p>The emergence-jacket splits without further delay; and the creature sheds its skin
from front to back. It is now the normal larva, the only one that Réaumur knew. The
cast slough forms a suspensory thread, expanding into a little cup at its free end.
In this cup is contained the tip of the abdomen of the larva, which, before dropping
to the ground, treats itself to a sun-bath, hardens <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>itself, kicks about and tries its strength, swinging indolently at the end of its
life-line.
</p>
<p>This “little Flea,” as Réaumur calls it, first white, then amber, is at all points
the larva that will dig into the ground. The antennæ, of fair length, are free and
wave about; the legs work their joints; those in front open and shut their claws,
which are the strongest part of them. I know hardly any more curious sight than that
of this miniature gymnast hanging by its hinder-part, swinging at the least breath
of wind and making ready in the air for its somersault into the world. The period
of suspension varies. Some larvæ let themselves drop in half an hour or so; others
remain for hours in their long-stemmed cup; and some even wait until the next day.
</p>
<p>Whether quick or slow, the creature’s fall leaves the cord, the slough of the primary
larva, swinging. When the whole brood has disappeared, the orifice of the cell is
thus hung with a cluster of short, fine threads, twisted and rumpled, like dried white
of egg. Each opens into a little cup at its free end. They are very delicate and ephemeral
relics, which you cannot touch without destroying <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>them. The slightest wind soon blows them away.
</p>
<p>Let us return to the larva. Sooner or later, without losing much time, it drops to
the ground, either by accident or of its own accord. The infinitesimal creature, no
bigger than a Flea, has saved its tender, budding flesh from the rough earth by swinging
on its cord. It has hardened itself in the air, that luxurious eiderdown. It now plunges
into the stern realities of life.
</p>
<p>I see a thousand dangers ahead of it. The merest breath of wind can blow the atom
here, on the impenetrable rock, or there, on the ocean of a rut where a little water
stagnates, or elsewhere, on the sand, the starvation region where nothing grows, or
again on a clay soil, too tough for digging. These fatal expanses are frequent; and
so are the gusts that blow one away in this windy season which has already set in
unpleasantly by the end of October.
</p>
<p>The feeble creature needs very soft soil, easily entered, so as to obtain shelter
immediately. The cold days are drawing nigh; the frosts are coming. To wander about
on the surface of the ground for any length of time would expose us to grave dangers.
We <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>had better descend into the earth without delay; and that to a good depth. This one
imperative condition of safety is in many cases impossible to realize. What can little
Flea’s-claws do against rock, flint or hardened clay? The tiny creature must perish
unless it can find an underground refuge in time.
</p>
<p>The first establishment, which is exposed to so many evil chances, is, so everything
shows us, a cause of great mortality in the Cicada’s family. Already the little black
parasite, the destroyer of the eggs, has told us how expedient it is for the mothers
to accomplish a long and fertile laying; the difficulties attendant upon the initial
installation in their turn explain why the maintenance of the race at its suitable
strength requires three or four hundred eggs to be laid by each of them. Subject to
excessive spoliation, the Cicada is fertile to excess. She averts by the richness
of her ovaries the multitude of dangers threatening her.
</p>
<p>In the experiment which it remains for me to make, I will at least spare the larva
the difficulties of the first installation. I select some very soft, very black heath-mould
and pass it through a fine sieve. Its dark <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>colour will enable me more easily to find the little yellow creature when I want to
see what is happening; and its softness will suit the feeble mattock. I heap it not
too tightly in a glass pot; I plant a little tuft of thyme in it; I sow a few grains
of wheat. There is no hole at the bottom of the pot, though there ought to be, if
the thyme and the wheat are to thrive; the captives, however, finding the hole, would
be certain to escape through it. The plantation will suffer from this lack of drainage;
but at least I am certain of finding my animals with the aid of my magnifying-glass
and plenty of patience. Besides, I shall indulge in no excesses in the matter of irrigation,
supplying only enough water to prevent the plants from dying.
</p>
<p>When everything is ready and the corn is beginning to put forth its first shoots,
I place six young Cicada-larvæ on the surface of the soil. The puny grubs run about
and explore the earthy bed pretty nimbly; some make unsuccessful attempts to climb
the side of the pot. Not one seems inclined to bury itself, so much so that I anxiously
wonder what the object can be of these active and prolonged investigations. Two hours
pass and the restless roaming never ceases.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>What is it that they want? Food? I offer them some little bulbs with bundles of sprouting
roots, a few bits of leaves and some fresh blades of grass. Nothing tempts them nor
induces them to stand still. They appear to be selecting a favourable spot before
descending underground. These hesitating explorations are superfluous on the soil
which I have industriously prepared for them: the whole surface, so it seems to me,
lends itself capitally to the work which I expect to see them accomplish. Apparently
it is not enough.
</p>
<p>Under natural conditions, a preliminary run round may well be indispensable. There,
sites as soft as my bed of heath-mould, purged of all hard bodies and finely sifted,
are rare. There, on the other hand, coarse soils, on which the microscopic mattock
can make no impression, are frequent. The grub has to roam at random, to walk about
for some time before finding a suitable place. No doubt many even die, exhausted by
their fruitless search. A journey of exploration, in a country a few inches across,
forms part, therefore, of the young Cicada’s curriculum. In my glass jar, so sumptuously
furnished, the pilgrimage is uncalled for. No matter: <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>it has to be performed according to the time-honoured rites.
</p>
<p>My gadabouts at last grow calm. I see them attack the earth with the hooked mattocks
of their fore-feet, digging into it and making the sort of excavation which the point
of a thick needle would produce. Armed with a magnifying-glass, I watch them wielding
their pick-axes, watch them raking an atom of earth to the surface. In a few minutes
a well has been scooped out. The little creature goes down it, buries itself and is
henceforth invisible.
</p>
<p>Next day I turn out the contents of the pot, without breaking the clod held together
by the roots of the thyme and the wheat. I find all my larvæ at the bottom, stopped
from going farther by the glass. In twenty-four hours they have traversed the entire
thickness of the layer of earth, about four inches. They would have gone even lower
but for the obstacle at the bottom.
</p>
<p>On their way they probably came across my thyme- and wheat-roots. Did they stop to
take a little nourishment by driving in their suckers? It is hardly probable. A few
of these rootlets are trailing at the bottom of the empty pot. Not one of my <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>six prisoners is installed on them. Perhaps in overturning the glass I have shaken
them off.
</p>
<p>It is clear that underground there can be no other food for them than the juice of
the roots. Whether full-grown or in the larval stage, the Cicada lives on vegetables.
As an adult, he drinks the sap of the branches; as a larva, he sucks the sap of the
roots. But at what moment is the first sip taken? This I do not yet know. What goes
before seems to tell us that the newly-hatched grub is in a greater hurry to reach
the depths of the soil, sheltered from the coming colds of winter, than to loiter
at the drinking-bars encountered on the way.
</p>
<p>I put back the clod of heath-mould and for the second time place the six exhumed larvæ
on the surface of the soil. Wells are dug without delay. The grubs disappear down
them. Finally I put the pot in my study-window, where it will receive all the influences
of the outer air, good and bad alike.
</p>
<p>A month later, at the end of November, I make a second inspection. The young Cicadæ
are crouching, each by itself, at the bottom of the clod of earth. They are not <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>clinging to the roots; they have not altered in appearance or in size. I find them
now just as I saw them at the beginning of the experiment, only a little less active.
Does not this absence of growth during the interval of November, the mildest month
of winter, seem to show that no nourishment is taken throughout the cold season?
</p>
<p>The young Sitaris-beetles,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1678src" href="#xd31e1678">11</a> those other animated atoms, as soon as they issue from the egg at the entrance to
the Anthophora’s<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1684src" href="#xd31e1684">12</a> galleries, remain in motionless heaps and spend the winter in complete abstinence.
The little Cicadæ would appear to behave in much the same manner. Once buried in depths
where there is no fear of frosts, they sleep, solitary, in their winter-quarters and
await the return of spring before broaching some root near by and taking their first
refreshment.
</p>
<p>I have tried, but without success, to confirm by actual observation the inferences
to be drawn from the above results. In the spring, in April, for the third time I
unpot my plantation. I break up the clod and <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>scrutinize it under the magnifying-glass. I feel as if I were looking for a needle
in a haystack. At last I find my little Cicadæ. They are dead, perhaps of cold, notwithstanding
the bell-glass with which I had covered the pot; perhaps of starvation, if the thyme
did not suit them. The problem is too difficult to solve; I give it up.
</p>
<p>To succeed in this attempt at rearing one would need a very wide and deep bed of earth,
providing a shelter from the rigours of winter, and, because I do not know which are
the insect’s favourite roots, there would also have to be a varied vegetation, in
which the little larvæ could choose according to their tastes. These conditions are
quite practicable; but how is one afterwards to find in that huge mass of earth, measuring
a cubic yard at least, the atom which I have so much trouble in distinguishing in
a handful of black mould? And, besides, such conscientious digging would certainly
detach the tiny creature from the root that nourishes it.
</p>
<p>The underground life of the early Cicada remains a secret. That of the well-developed
larva is no better-known. When digging in the fields, if you turn up the soil to any
depth, you are constantly finding the fierce <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>little burrower under your spade; but to find it fastened to the roots from whose
sap it undoubtedly derives its nourishment is quite another matter. The upheaval occasioned
by the spade warns it of its danger. It releases its sucker and retreats to some gallery;
and, when discovered, it is no longer drinking.
</p>
<p>If agricultural digging, with its inevitable disturbances, is unable to tell us anything
of the grub’s underground habits, it does at least inform us how long the larval stage
lasts. Some obliging husbandmen, breaking up their land, in March, rather deeper than
usual, were so very good as to pick up for me all the larvæ, big and small, unearthed
by their labour. The harvest amounted to several hundreds. Marked differences in bulk
divided the total into three classes: the large ones, with rudiments of wings similar
to those possessed by the larvæ leaving the ground, the medium-sized and the small.
Each of these classes must correspond with a different age. We will add to them the
larvæ of the last hatching, microscopic creatures that necessarily escaped the eyes
of my rustic collaborators; and we arrive at four years as the probable duration of
the underground life of the Cicadæ.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their existence in the air is more easily calculated. I hear the first Cicadæ at the
approach of the summer solstice. The orchestra attains its full strength a month later.
A few laggards, very few and very far between, continue to execute their faint solos
until the middle of September. That is the end of the concert. As they do not all
come out of the ground at the same period, it is obvious that the singers of September
are not contemporary with those of June. If we strike an average between these two
extreme dates, we shall have about five weeks.
</p>
<p>Four years of hard work underground and a month of revelry in the sun: this then represents
the Cicada’s life. Let us no longer blame the adult for his delirious triumph. For
four years, in the darkness, he has worn a dirty parchment smock; for four years he
has dug the earth with his mattocks; and behold the mud-stained navvy suddenly attired
in exquisite raiment, possessed of wings that rival the bird’s, drunk with the heat
and inundated with light, the supreme joy of this world! What cymbals could ever be
loud enough to celebrate such felicity, so richly earned and so ephemeral!

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MANTIS: HER HUNTING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another creature of the south, at least as interesting as the Cicada, but much less
famous, because it makes no noise. Had Heaven granted it a pair of cymbals, the one
thing needed, its renown would eclipse the great musician’s, for it is most unusual
in both shape and habits. Folk hereabouts call it <i lang="fr">lou Prègo-Diéu</i>, the animal that prays to God. Its official name is the Praying Mantis (<i lang="la">M. religiosa</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>).
</p>
<p>The language of science and the peasant’s artless vocabulary agree in this case and
represent the queer creature as a pythoness delivering her oracles or an ascetic rapt
in pious ecstasy. The comparison dates a long way back. Even in the time of the Greeks
the insect was called <span class="trans" title="Mantis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Μάντις</span></span>, the divine, the prophet. The tiller of the soil is not particular about analogies:
where points of resemblance are not too clear, he will make <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>up for their deficiencies. He saw on the sun-scorched herbage an insect of imposing
appearance, drawn up majestically in a half-erect posture. He noticed its gossamer
wings, broad and green, trailing like long veils of finest lawn; he saw its fore-legs,
its arms so to speak, raised to the sky in a gesture of invocation. That was enough;
popular imagination did the rest; and behold the bushes from ancient times stocked
with Delphic priestesses, with nuns in orison.
</p>
<p>Good people, with your childish simplicity, how great was your mistake! Those sanctimonious
airs are a mask for Satanic habits; those arms folded in prayer are cut-throat weapons:
they tell no beads, they slay whatever passes within range. Forming an exception which
one would never have suspected in the herbivorous order of the Orthoptera, the Mantis
feeds exclusively on living prey. She is the tigress of the peaceable entomological
tribes, the ogress in ambush who levies a tribute of fresh meat. Picture her with
sufficient strength; and her carnivorous appetites, combined with her traps of horrible
perfection, would make her the terror of the country-side. The <i lang="fr">Prègo-Diéu</i> would become a devilish vampire.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apart from her lethal implement, the Mantis has nothing to inspire dread. She is not
without a certain beauty, in fact, with her slender figure, her elegant bust, her
pale-green colouring and her long gauze wings. No ferocious mandibles, opening like
shears; on the contrary, a dainty pointed muzzle that seems made for billing and cooing.
Thanks to a flexible neck, quite independent of the thorax, the head is able to move
freely, to turn to right or left, to bend, to lift itself. Alone among insects, the
Mantis directs her gaze; she inspects and examines; she almost has a physiognomy.
</p>
<p>Great indeed is the contrast between the body as a whole, with its very pacific aspect,
and the murderous mechanism of the fore-legs, which are correctly described as raptorial.
The haunch is uncommonly long and powerful. Its function is to throw forward the rat-trap,
which does not await its victim but goes in search of it. The snare is decked out
with some show of finery. The base of the haunch is adorned on the inner surface with
a pretty, black mark, having a white spot in the middle; and a few rows of bead-like
dots complete the ornamentation.
</p>
<p>The thigh, longer still, a sort of flattened <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>spindle, carries on the front half of its lower surface two rows of sharp spikes.
In the inner row there are a dozen, alternately black and green, the green being shorter
than the black. This alternation of unequal lengths increases the number of cogs and
improves the effectiveness of the weapon. The outer row is simpler and has only four
teeth. Lastly, three spurs, the longest of all, stand out behind the two rows. In
short, the thigh is a saw with two parallel blades, separated by a groove in which
the leg lies when folded back.
</p>
<p>The leg, which moves very easily on its joint with the thigh, is likewise a double-edged
saw. The teeth are smaller, more numerous and closer together than those on the thigh.
It ends in a strong hook whose point vies with the finest needle for sharpness, a
hook fluted underneath and having a double blade like a curved pruning-knife.
</p>
<p>This hook, a most perfect instrument for piercing and tearing, has left me many a
painful memory. How often, when Mantis-hunting, clawed by the insect which I had just
caught and not having both hands at liberty, have I been obliged to ask somebody else
to release me from my tenacious captive! <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>To try to free yourself by force, without first disengaging the claws implanted in
your flesh, would expose you to scratches similar to those produced by the thorns
of a rose-tree. None of our insects is so troublesome to handle. The Mantis claws
you with her pruning-hooks, pricks you with her spikes, seizes you in her vice and
makes self-defence almost impossible if, wishing to keep your prize alive, you refrain
from giving the pinch of the thumb that would put an end to the struggle by crushing
the creature.
</p>
<p>When at rest, the trap is folded and pressed back against the chest and looks quite
harmless. There you have the insect praying. But, should a victim pass, the attitude
of prayer is dropped abruptly. Suddenly unfolded, the three long sections of the machine
throw to a distance their terminal grapnel, which harpoons the prey and, in returning,
draws it back between the two saws. The vice closes with a movement like that of the
fore-arm and the upper arm; and all is over: Locusts, Grasshoppers and others even
more powerful, once caught in the mechanism with its four rows of teeth, are irretrievably
lost. Neither their desperate <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>fluttering nor their kicking will make the terrible engine release its hold.
</p>
<p>An uninterrupted study of the Mantis’ habits is not practicable in the open fields;
we must rear her at home. There is no difficulty about this: she does not mind being
interned under glass, on condition that she be well fed. Offer her choice viands,
served up fresh daily, and she will hardly feel her absence from the bushes.
</p>
<p>As cages for my captives I have some ten large wire-gauze dish-covers, the same that
are used to protect meat from the Flies. Each stands in a pan filled with sand. A
dry tuft of thyme and a flat stone on which the laying may be done later constitute
all the furniture. These huts are placed in a row on the large table in my insect
laboratory, where the sun shines on them for the best part of the day. I instal my
captives in them, some singly, some in groups.
</p>
<p>It is in the second fortnight of August that I begin to come upon the adult Mantis
in the withered grass and on the brambles by the road-side. The females, already notably
corpulent, are more frequent from day to day. Their slender companions, on the other
hand, are rather scarce; and I sometimes <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>have a good deal of difficulty in making up my couples, for there is an appalling
consumption of these dwarfs in the cages. Let us keep these atrocities for later and
speak first of the females.
</p>
<p>They are great eaters, whose maintenance, when it has to last for some months, is
none too easy. The provisions, which are nibbled at disdainfully and nearly all wasted,
have to be renewed almost every day. I trust that the Mantis is more economical on
her native bushes. When game is not plentiful, no doubt she devours every atom of
her catch; in my cages she is extravagant, often dropping and abandoning the rich
morsel after a few mouthfuls, without deriving any further benefit from it. This appears
to be her particular method of beguiling the tedium of captivity.
</p>
<p>To cope with these extravagant ways I have to employ assistants. Two or three small
local idlers, bribed by the promise of a slice of melon or bread-and-butter, go morning
and evening to the grass-plots in the neighbourhood and fill their game-bags—cases
made of reed-stumps—with live Locusts and Grasshoppers. I on my side, net in hand,
make a daily circuit of my enclosure, <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>in the hope of obtaining some choice morsel for my boarders.
</p>
<p>These tit-bits are intended to show me to what lengths the Mantis’ strength and daring
can go. They include the big Grey Locust (<i lang="la">Pachytylus cinerescens</i>, <span class="sc">Fab.</span>), who is larger than the insect that will consume him; the White-faced Decticus,
armed with a vigorous pair of mandibles whereof our fingers would do well to fight
shy; the quaint Tryxalis, who wears a pyramid-shaped mitre on her head; the Vine Ephippiger,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1777src" href="#xd31e1777">1</a> who clashes cymbals and sports a sword at the bottom of her pot-belly. To this assortment
of game that is not any too easy to tackle, let us add two monsters, two of the largest
Spiders of the district: the Silky Epeira, whose flat, festooned abdomen is the size
of a franc piece; and the Cross Spider, or Diadem Epeira,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1781src" href="#xd31e1781">2</a> who is hideously hairy and obese.
</p>
<p>I cannot doubt that the Mantis attacks such adversaries in the open, when I see her,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>under my covers, boldly giving battle to whatever comes in sight. Lying in wait among
the bushes, she must profit by the fat prizes offered by chance even as, in the wire
cage, she profits by the treasures due to my generosity. Those big hunts, full of
danger, are no new thing; they form part of her normal existence. Nevertheless they
appear to be rare, for want of opportunity, perhaps to the Mantis’ deep regret.
</p>
<p>Locusts of all kinds, Butterflies, Dragon-flies, large Flies, Bees and other moderate-sized
captures are what we usually find in the lethal limbs. Still the fact remains that,
in my cages, the daring huntress recoils before nothing. Sooner or later, Grey Locust
and Decticus, Epeira and Tryxalis are harpooned, held tight between the saws and crunched
with gusto. The facts are worth describing.
</p>
<p>At the sight of the Grey Locust who has heedlessly approached along the trelliswork
of the cover, the Mantis gives a convulsive shiver and suddenly adopts a terrifying
posture. An electric shock would not produce a more rapid effect. The transition is
so abrupt, the attitude so threatening that the observer beholding it for the first
time at <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>once hesitates and draws back his fingers, apprehensive of some unknown danger. Old
hand as I am, I cannot even now help being startled, should I happen to be thinking
of something else.
</p>
<p>You see before you, most unexpectedly, a sort of bogey-man or Jack-in-the-box. The
wing-covers open and are turned back on either side, slantingly; the wings spread
to their full extent and stand erect like parallel sails or like a huge heraldic crest
towering over the back; the tip of the abdomen curls upwards like a crosier, rises
and falls, relaxing with short jerks and a sort of sough, a “Whoof! Whoof!” like that
of a Turkey-cock spreading his tail. It reminds one of the puffing of a startled Adder.
</p>
<p>Planted defiantly on its four hind-legs, the insect holds its long bust almost upright.
The murderous legs, originally folded and pressed together upon the chest, open wide,
forming a cross with the body and revealing the arm-pits decorated with rows of beads
and a black spot with a white dot in the centre. These two faint imitations of the
eyes in a Peacock’s tail, together with the dainty ivory beads, are warlike ornaments
kept hidden at ordinary times. They are <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>taken from the jewel-case only at the moment when we have to make ourselves brave
and terrible for battle.
</p>
<p>Motionless in her strange posture, the Mantis watches the Locust, with her eyes fixed
in his direction and her head turning as on a pivot whenever the other changes his
place. The object of this attitudinizing is evident: the Mantis wants to strike terror
into her dangerous quarry, to paralyze it with fright, for, unless demoralized by
fear, it would prove too formidable.
</p>
<p>Does she succeed in this? Under the shiny head of the Decticus, behind the long face
of the Locust, who can tell what passes? No sign of excitement betrays itself to our
eyes on those impassive masks. Nevertheless it is certain that the threatened one
is aware of the danger. He sees standing before him a spectre, with uplifted claws,
ready to fall upon him; he feels that he is face to face with death; and he fails
to escape while there is yet time. He who excels in leaping and could so easily hop
out of reach of those talons, he, the big-thighed jumper, remains stupidly where he
is, or even draws nearer with a leisurely step.
</p>
<p>They say that little birds, paralysed with <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>terror before the open jaws of the Snake, spell-bound by the reptile’s gaze, lose
their power of flight and allow themselves to be snapped up. The Locust often behaves
in much the same way. See him within reach of the enchantress. The two grapnels fall,
the claws strike, the double saws close and clutch. In vain the poor wretch protests:
he chews space with his mandibles and, kicking desperately, strikes nothing but the
air. His fate is sealed. The Mantis furls her wings, her battle-standard; she resumes
her normal posture; and the meal begins.
</p>
<p>In attacking the Tryxalis and the Ephippiger, less dangerous game than the Grey Locust
and the Decticus, the spectral attitude is less imposing and of shorter duration.
Often the throw of the grapnels is sufficient. This is likewise so in the case of
the Epeira, who is grasped round the body with not a thought of her poison-fangs.
With the smaller Locusts, the usual fare in my cages as in the open fields, the Mantis
seldom employs her intimidation-methods and contents herself with seizing the reckless
one that passes within her reach.
</p>
<p>When the prey to be captured is able to offer serious resistance, the Mantis has at
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>her service a pose that terrorizes and fascinates her quarry and gives her claws a
means of hitting with certainty. Her rat-traps close on a demoralized victim incapable
of defence. She frightens her victim into immobility by suddenly striking a spectral
attitude.
</p>
<p>The wings play a great part in this fantastic pose. They are very wide, green on the
outer edge, colourless and transparent every elsewhere. They are crossed lengthwise
by numerous veins, which spread in the shape of a fan. Other veins, transversal and
finer, intersect the first at right angles and with them form a multitude of meshes.
In the spectral attitude, the wings are displayed and stand upright in two parallel
planes that almost touch each other, like the wings of a Butterfly at rest. Between
them the curled tip of the abdomen moves with sudden starts. The sort of breath which
I have compared with the puffing of an Adder in a posture of defence comes from this
rubbing of the abdomen against the nerves of the wings. To imitate the strange sound,
all that you need do is to pass your nail quickly over the upper surface of an unfurled
wing.
</p>
<p>Wings are essential to the male, a slender <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>pigmy who has to wander from thicket to thicket at mating-time. He has a well-developed
pair, more than sufficient for his flight, the greatest range of which hardly amounts
to four or five of our paces. The little fellow is exceedingly sober in his appetites.
On rare occasions, in my cages, I catch him eating a lean Locust, an insignificant,
perfectly harmless creature. This means that he knows nothing of the spectral attitude,
which is of no use to an unambitious hunter of his kind.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the advantage of the wings to the female is not very obvious, for
she is inordinately stout at the time when her eggs ripen. She climbs, she runs; but,
weighed down by her corpulence, she never flies. Then what is the object of wings,
of wings, too, which are seldom matched for breadth?
</p>
<p>The question becomes more significant if we consider the Grey Mantis (<i lang="la">Ameles decolor</i>), who is closely akin to the Praying Mantis. The male is winged and is even pretty
quick at flying. The female, who drags a great belly full of eggs, reduces her wings
to stumps and, like the cheese-makers of Auvergne and Savoy, wears a short-tailed
<span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>jacket. For one who is not meant to leave the dry grass and the stones, this abbreviated
costume is more suitable than superfluous gauze furbelows. The Grey Mantis is right
to retain but a mere vestige of the cumbrous sails.
</p>
<p>Is the other wrong to keep her wings, to exaggerate them, even though she never flies?
Not at all. The Praying Mantis hunts big game. Sometimes a formidable prey appears
in her hiding-place. A direct attack might be fatal. The thing to do is first to intimidate
the new-comer, to conquer his resistance by terror. With this object she suddenly
unfurls her wings into a ghost’s winding-sheet. The huge sails incapable of flight
are hunting-implements. This stratagem is not needed by the little Grey Mantis, who
captures feeble prey, such as Gnats and new-born Locusts. The two huntresses, who
have similar habits and, because of their stoutness, are neither of them able to fly,
are dressed to suit the difficulties of the ambuscade. The first, an impetuous amazon,
puffs her wings into a threatening standard; the second, a modest fowler, reduces
them to a pair of scanty coat-tails.
</p>
<p>In a fit of hunger, after a fast of some <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>days’ duration, the Praying Mantis will gobble up a Grey Locust whole, except for
the wings, which are too dry; and yet the victim of her voracity is as big as herself,
or even bigger. Two hours are enough for consuming this monstrous head of game. An
orgy of the sort is rare. I have witnessed it once or twice and have always wondered
how the gluttonous creature found room for so much food and how it reversed in its
favour the axiom that the cask must be greater than its contents. I can but admire
the lofty privileges of a stomach through which matter merely passes, being at once
digested, dissolved and done away with.
</p>
<p>The usual bill of fare in my cages consists of Locusts of greatly varied species and
sizes. It is interesting to watch the Mantis nibbling her Acridian, firmly held in
the grip of her two murderous fore-legs. Notwithstanding the fine, pointed muzzle,
which seems scarcely made for this gorging, the whole dish disappears, with the exception
of the wings, of which only the slightly fleshy base is consumed. The legs, the tough
skin, everything goes down. Sometimes the Mantis seizes one of the big hinder thighs
by the knuckle-end, lifts it to her mouth, <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>tastes it and crunches it with a little air of satisfaction. The Locust’s fat and
juicy thigh may well be a choice morsel for her, even as a leg of mutton is for us.
</p>
<p>The prey is first attacked in the neck. While one of the two lethal legs holds the
victim transfixed through the middle of the body, the other presses the head and makes
the neck open upwards. The Mantis’ muzzle roots and nibbles at this weak point in
the armour with some persistency. A large wound appears in the head. The Locust gradually
ceases kicking and becomes a lifeless corpse; and, from this moment, freer in its
movements, the carnivorous insect picks and chooses its morsel.
</p>
<p>This preliminary gnawing of the neck is too regular an occurrence to be purposeless.
Let us indulge in a digression which will tell us more about it. In June I often find
on the lavender in the enclosure two small Crab Spiders (<i lang="la">Thomisus onustus</i>, <span class="sc">Walck.</span>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1850src" href="#xd31e1850">3</a> and <i lang="la">T. rotundatus</i>, <span class="sc">Walck.</span>). One is satin-white and has pink and green rings round her legs; the other is inky-black
and has an abdomen encircled with red with a foliaceous <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>central patch. They are pretty Spiders, both of them, and they walk sideways, after
the manner of Crabs. They do not know how to weave a hunting-net; the little silk
which they possess is reserved exclusively for the downy satchel containing the eggs.
Their plan of campaign therefore is to lie in ambush on the flowers and to fling themselves
unexpectedly on the quarry when it arrives on pilfering intent.
</p>
<p>Their favourite prey is the Hive-bee. I often come upon them with their prize, at
times grabbed by the neck and at others by any part of the body, even the tip of a
wing. In each and every case the Bee is dead, with her legs hanging limply and her
tongue out.
</p>
<p>The poison-fangs planted in the neck set me thinking; I see in them a characteristic
remarkably like the practice of the Mantis when starting on her Locust. And then arises
another question: how does the weak Spider, who is vulnerable in every part of her
soft body, manage to get hold of a prey like the Bee, stronger than herself, quicker
in movement and armed with a sting that can inflict a mortal wound?
</p>
<p>The difference in physical strength and force of arms between assailant and assailed
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>is so very great that a contest of this kind seems impossible unless some netting
intervene, some silken toils that can shackle and bind the formidable creature. The
contrast would be no more intense were the Sheep to take it into her head to fly at
the Wolf’s throat. And yet the daring attack takes place and victory goes to the weaker,
as is proved by the numbers of dead Bees whom I see sucked for hours by the Thomisi.
The relative weakness must be made good by some special art; the Spider must possess
a strategy that enables her to surmount the apparently insurmountable difficulty.
</p>
<p>To watch events on the lavender-borders would expose me to long, fruitless waits.
It is better myself to make the preparations for the duel. I place a Thomisus under
a cover with a bunch of lavender sprinkled with a few drops of honey. Some three or
four live Bees complete the establishment.
</p>
<p>The Bees pay no heed to their redoubtable neighbour. They flutter around the trellised
enclosure; from time to time they go and take a sip from the honeyed flowers, sometimes
quite close to the Spider, not a quarter of an inch away. They seem utterly unaware
of their danger. The experience of <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>centuries has taught them nothing about the terrible cut-throat. The Thomisus, on
her side, waits motionless on a spike of lavender, near the honey. Her four front
legs, which are longer than the others, are spread out and slightly raised, in readiness
for attack.
</p>
<p>A Bee comes to drink at the drop of honey. This is the moment. The Spider springs
forward and with her fangs seizes the imprudent one by the tip of the wings, while
her legs hold the victim in a tight embrace. A few seconds pass, during which the
Bee struggles as best she can against the aggressor on her back, out of the reach
of her dagger. This fight at close quarters cannot last long; the Bee would release
herself from the other’s grip. And so the Spider lets go the wing and suddenly bites
her prey in the back of the neck. Once the fangs drive home, it is all over: death
ensues. The Bee is slain. Of her turbulent activity naught lingers but some faint
quivers of the tarsi, final convulsions which are soon at an end.
</p>
<p>Still holding her prey by the nape of the neck, the Thomisus feasts not on the body,
which remains intact, but on the blood, which is slowly sucked. When the neck is drained
dry, another spot is attacked, on the abdomen, <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>the thorax, anywhere. This explains why my observations in the open air showed me
the Thomisus with her fangs fixed now in the neck, now in some other part of the Bee.
In the first case, the capture was a recent one and the murderess still retained her
original posture; in the second case, it had been made some time before; and the Spider
had forsaken the wound in the head, now sucked dry, to bite into some other juicy
part, no matter which.
</p>
<p>Thus shifting her fangs, a trifle this way or that, as she drains her prey, the little
ogress gorges on her victim’s blood with voluptuous deliberation. I have seen the
meal last for seven consecutive hours; and even then the prey was let go only because
of the shock given to its devourer by my indiscreet examination. The abandoned corpse,
a carcass of no value to the Spider, is not dismembered in any way. There is not a
trace of bitten flesh, not a wound that shows. The Bee is drained of her blood; and
that is all.
</p>
<p>My friend Bull, when he was alive, used to catch an enemy whose teeth threatened danger
by the skin of the neck. His method is in general use throughout the canine race.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>There, in front of you, is a growling pair of jaws, open, white with foam, ready to
bite. The most elementary prudence advises you to keep them quiet by catching hold
of the back of the neck.
</p>
<p>In her fight with the Bee, the Spider has not the same object. What has she to fear
from her victim? The sting before all things, the terrible dart whose least stab would
destroy her. And yet she does not trouble about it. What she makes for is the back
of the neck, that alone and never anything else, so long as the prey remains alive.
In so doing she does not aim at copying the tactics of the Dog and depriving the head,
which is not particularly dangerous, of its power of movement. Her plan is farther-reaching
and is revealed to us by the lightning death of the Bee. The neck is no sooner gripped
than the victim expires. The cerebral centres therefore are injured, poisoned with
a deadly virus; and life is straightway extinguished at its very seat. This avoids
a struggle which, if prolonged, would certainly end in the aggressor’s discomfiture.
The Bee has her strength and her sting on her side; the delicate Thomisus has on hers
a profound knowledge of the art of murder.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us return to the Mantis, who likewise has mastered the first principles of speedy
and scientific killing, in which the little Bee-slaughtering Spider excels. A sturdy
Locust is captured; sometimes a powerful Grasshopper. The Mantis naturally wants to
devour the victuals in peace, without being troubled by the plunges of a victim who
absolutely refuses to be devoured. A meal liable to interruptions lacks savour. Now
the principal means of defence in this case are the hind-legs, those vigorous levers
which can kick out so brutally and which moreover are armed with toothed saws that
would rip open the Mantis’ bulky paunch if by ill-luck they happen to graze it. What
shall we do to reduce them to helplessness, together with the others, which are not
dangerous but troublesome all the same, with their desperate gesticulations?
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, it would be practicable to cut them off one by one. But that is
a long process and attended with a certain risk. The Mantis has hit upon something
better. She has an intimate knowledge of the anatomy of the spine. By first attacking
her prize at the back of the half-opened neck and munching the cervical ganglia, she
destroys <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>the muscular energy at its main seat; and inertia supervenes, not suddenly and completely,
for the clumsily-constructed Locust has not the Bee’s exquisite and frail vitality,
but still sufficiently, after the first mouthfuls. Soon the kicking and the gesticulating
die down, all movement ceases and the game, however big it be, is consumed in perfect
quiet.
</p>
<p>Among the hunters, I have before now drawn a distinction between those who paralyse
and those who kill.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1897src" href="#xd31e1897">4</a> Both terrify one with their anatomical knowledge. To-day let us add to the killers
the Thomisus, that expert in stabbing in the neck, and the Mantis, who, to devour
a powerful prey at her ease, deprives it of movement by first gnawing its cervical
ganglia.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MANTIS: HER LOVE-MAKING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little that we have seen of the Mantis’ habits hardly tallies with what we might
have expected from her popular name. To judge by the term <i lang="fr">Prègo-Diéu</i>, we should look to see a placid insect, deep in pious contemplation; and we find
ourselves in the presence of a cannibal, of a ferocious spectre munching the brain
of a panic-stricken victim. Nor is even this the most tragic part. The Mantis has
in store for us, in her relations with her own kith and kin, manners even more atrocious
than those prevailing among the Spiders, who have an evil reputation in this respect.
</p>
<p>To reduce the number of cages on my big table and give myself a little more space
while still retaining a fair-sized menagerie, I instal several females, sometimes
as many as a dozen, under one cover. So far as accommodation is concerned, no fault
can be found <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>with the common lodging. There is room and to spare for the evolutions of my captives,
who naturally do not want to move about much with their unwieldy bellies. Hanging
to the trelliswork of the dome, motionless they digest their food or else await an
unwary passer-by. Even so do they act when at liberty in the thickets.
</p>
<p>Cohabitation has its dangers. I know that even Donkeys, those peace-loving animals,
quarrel when hay is scarce in the manger. My boarders, who are less complaisant, might
well, in a moment of dearth, become sour-tempered and fight among themselves. I guard
against this by keeping the cages well supplied with Locusts, renewed twice a day.
Should civil war break out, famine cannot be pleaded as the excuse.
</p>
<p>At first, things go pretty well. The community lives in peace, each Mantis grabbing
and eating whatever comes near her, without seeking strife with her neighbours. But
this harmonious period does not last long. The bellies swell, the eggs are ripening
in the ovaries, marriage and laying-time are at hand. Then a sort of jealous fury
bursts out, though there is an entire absence of males who might be held responsible
for <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>feminine rivalry. The working of the ovaries seems to pervert the flock, inspiring
its members with a mania for devouring one another. There are threats, personal encounters,
cannibal feasts. Once more the spectral pose appears, the hissing of the wings, the
fearsome gesture of the grapnels outstretched and uplifted in the air. No hostile
demonstration in front of a Grey Locust or White-faced Decticus could be more menacing.
</p>
<p>For no reason that I can gather, two neighbours suddenly assume their attitude of
war. They turn their heads to right and left, provoking each other, exchanging insulting
glances. The “Puff! Puff!” of the wings rubbed by the abdomen sounds the charge. When
the duel is to be limited to the first scratch received, without more serious consequences,
the lethal fore-arms, which are usually kept folded, open like the leaves of a book
and fall back sideways, encircling the long bust. It is a superb pose, but less terrible
than that adopted in a fight to the death.
</p>
<p>Then one of the grapnels, with a sudden spring, shoots out to its full length and
strikes the rival; it is no less abruptly withdrawn <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>and resumes the defensive. The adversary hits back. The fencing is rather like that
of two Cats boxing each other’s ears. At the first blood drawn from her flabby paunch,
or even before receiving the least wound, one of the duellists confesses herself beaten
and retires. The other furls her battle-standard and goes off elsewhither to meditate
the capture of a Locust, keeping apparently calm, but ever ready to repeat the quarrel.
</p>
<p>Very often, events take a more tragic turn. At such times, the full posture of the
duels to the death is assumed. The murderous fore-arms are unfolded and raised in
the air. Woe to the vanquished! The other seizes her in her vice and then and there
proceeds to eat her, beginning at the neck, of course. The loathsome feast takes place
as calmly as though it were a matter of crunching up a Grasshopper. The diner enjoys
her sister as she would a lawful dish; and those around do not protest, being quite
willing to do as much on the first occasion.
</p>
<p>Oh, what savagery! Why, even Wolves are said not to eat one another. The Mantis has
no such scruples; she banquets off her fellows when there is plenty of her favourite
<span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>game, the Locust, around her. She practises the equivalent of cannibalism, that hideous
peculiarity of man.
</p>
<p>These aberrations, these child-bed cravings can reach an even more revolting stage.
Let us watch the pairing and, to avoid the disorder of a crowd, let us isolate the
couples under different covers. Each pair shall have its own home, where none will
come to disturb the wedding. And let us not forget the provisions, with which we will
keep them well supplied, so that there may be no excuse of hunger.
</p>
<p>It is near the end of August. The male, that slender swain, thinks the moment propitious.
He makes eyes at his strapping companion; he turns his head in her direction; he bends
his neck and throws out his chest. His little pointed face wears an almost impassioned
expression. Motionless, in this posture, for a long time he contemplates the object
of his desire. She does not stir, is as though indifferent. The lover, however, has
caught a sign of acquiescence, a sign of which I do not know the secret. He goes nearer;
suddenly he spreads his wings, which quiver with a convulsive tremor. That is his
declaration. He rushes, small as he is, upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>the back of his corpulent companion, clings on as best he can, steadies his hold.
As a rule, the preliminaries last a long time. At last, coupling takes place and is
also long drawn out, lasting sometimes for five or six hours.
</p>
<p>Nothing worthy of attention happens between the two motionless partners. They end
by separating, but only to unite again in a more intimate fashion. If the poor fellow
is loved by his lady as the vivifier of her ovaries, he is also loved as a piece of
highly-flavoured game. And, that same day, or at latest on the morrow, he is seized
by his spouse, who first gnaws his neck, in accordance with precedent, and then eats
him deliberately, by little mouthfuls, leaving only the wings. Here we have no longer
a case of jealousy in the harem, but simply a depraved appetite.
</p>
<p>I was curious to know what sort of reception a second male might expect from a recently
fertilized female. The result of my enquiry was shocking. The Mantis, in many cases,
is never sated with conjugal raptures and banquets. After a rest that varies in length,
whether the eggs be laid or not, a second male is accepted and then devoured <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>like the first. A third succeeds him, performs his function in life, is eaten and
disappears. A fourth undergoes a like fate. In the course of two weeks I thus see
one and the same Mantis use up seven males. She takes them all to her bosom and makes
them all pay for the nuptial ecstasy with their lives.
</p>
<p>Orgies such as this are frequent, in varying degrees, though there are exceptions.
On very hot days, highly charged with electricity, they are almost the general rule.
At such times the Mantes are in a very irritable mood. In the cages containing a large
colony, the females devour one another more than ever; in the cages containing separate
pairs, the males, after coupling, are more than ever treated as an ordinary prey.
</p>
<p>I should like to be able to say, in mitigation of these conjugal atrocities, that
the Mantis does not behave like this in a state of liberty; that the male, after doing
his duty, has time to get out of the way, to make off, to escape from his terrible
mistress, for in my cages he is given a respite, lasting sometimes until next day.
What really occurs in the thickets I do not know, chance, a poor resource, having
never instructed me <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>concerning the love-affairs of the Mantis when at large. I can only go by what happens
in the cages, where the captives, enjoying plenty of sunshine and food and spacious
quarters, do not seem to suffer from homesickness in any way. What they do here they
must also do under normal conditions.
</p>
<p>Well, what happens there utterly refutes the idea that the males are given time to
escape. I find, by themselves, a horrible couple engaged as follows. The male, absorbed
in the performance of his vital functions, holds the female in a tight embrace. But
the wretch has no head; he has no neck; he has hardly a body. The other, with her
muzzle turned over her shoulder continues very placidly to gnaw what remains of the
gentle swain. And, all the time, that masculine stump, holding on firmly, goes on
with the business!
</p>
<p>Love is stronger than death, men say. Taken literally, the aphorism has never received
a more brilliant confirmation. A headless creature, an insect amputated down to the
middle of the chest, a very corpse persists in endeavouring to give life. It will
not let go until the abdomen, the seat of the procreative organs, is attacked.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>Eating the lover after consummation of marriage, making a meal of the exhausted dwarf,
henceforth good for nothing, can be understood, to some extent, in the insect world,
which has no great scruples in matters of sentiment; but gobbling him up during the
act goes beyond the wildest dreams of the most horrible imagination. I have seen it
done with my own eyes and have not yet recovered from my astonishment.
</p>
<p>Was this one able to escape and get out of the way, caught as he was in the midst
of his duty? Certainly not. Hence we must infer that the loves of the Mantis are tragic,
quite as much as the Spider’s and perhaps even more so. I admit that the restricted
space inside the cages favours the slaughter of the males; but the cause of these
massacres lies elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a relic of the palæozoic ages, when, in the carboniferous period, the
insect came into being as the result of monstrous amours. The Orthoptera, to whom
the Mantes belong, are the first-born of the entomological world. Rough-hewn, incomplete
in their transformation, they roamed among the arborescent ferns and were already
flourishing when none of the insects <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>with delicate metamorphoses, Butterflies, Moths, Beetles, Flies and Bees, as yet existed.
Manners were not gentle in those days of passion eager to destroy in order to produce;
and the Mantes, a faint memory of the ghosts of old, might well continue the amorous
methods of a bygone age.
</p>
<p>The habit of eating the males is customary among other members of the Mantis family.
I am indeed prepared to admit that it is general. The little Grey Mantis, who looks
so sweet and so peaceable in my cages, never seeking a quarrel with her neighbours
however crowded they may be, bites into her male and feeds on him as fiercely as the
Praying Mantis herself. I wear myself out, scouring the country to procure the indispensable
complement to my gynæceum. No sooner is my powerfully-winged and nimble prize introduced
than, most often, he is clawed and eaten up by one of those who no longer need his
aid. Once the ovaries are satisfied, the Mantes of both species abhor the male, or
rather look upon him as nothing better than a choice piece of venison.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MANTIS: HER NEST</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us show the insect of the tragic amours under a more attractive aspect. Its nest
is a marvel. In scientific language it is called <i>ootheca</i>, the egg-case. I shall not overwork this outlandish term. We do not say, “the Chaffinch’s
egg-case,” when we mean, “the Chaffinch’s nest:” why should I be obliged to talk about
a case when I speak of the Mantis? It may sound more learned; but that is not my business.
</p>
<p>The nest of the Praying Mantis is found more or less everywhere in sunny places, on
stones, wood, vine-stocks, twigs, dry grass and even on products of human industry,
such as bits of brick, strips of coarse linen or the hard, shrivelled leather of an
old boot. Any support serves, without distinction, so long as there is an uneven surface
to which the bottom of the nest can be fixed, thus securing a solid foundation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>The usual dimensions are four centimetres in length and two in width.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1976src" href="#xd31e1976">1</a> The colour is as golden as a grain of wheat. When set alight, the material burns
readily and exhales a faint smell of singed silk. The substance is in fact akin to
silk; only, instead of being drawn into thread, it has curdled into a frothy mass.
When the nest is fixed to a branch, the base goes round the nearest twigs, envelops
them and assumes a shape which varies in accordance with the support encountered;
when it is fixed to a flat surface, the under side, which is always moulded on the
support, is itself flat. The nest thereupon takes the form of a semi-ellipsoid, more
or less blunt at one end, tapering at the other and often ending in a short, curved
tail.
</p>
<p>Whatever the support, the upper surface of the nest is systematically convex. We can
distinguish in it three well-marked longitudinal zones. The middle one, which is narrower
than the others, is composed of little plates or scales arranged in pairs and overlapping
like the tiles of a roof. The edges of these plates are free, leaving two parallel
rows of slits or fissures through <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>which the young emerge at hatching-time. In a recently-abandoned nest, this middle
zone is furry with gossamer skins, discarded by the larvæ. These cast skins flutter
at the least breath and soon vanish when exposed to rough weather. I will call it
the exit-zone, because it is only along this median belt that the liberation of the
young takes place, thanks to the outlets contrived beforehand.
</p>
<p>In every other part the cradle of the numerous family presents an impenetrable wall.
The two side zones, in fact, which occupy the greater part of the semi-ellipsoid,
have perfect continuity of surface. The little Mantes, so feeble at the start, could
never make their way out through so tough a substance. All that we see on it is a
number of fine, transversal furrows, marking the various layers of which the mass
of eggs consists.
</p>
<p>Cut the nest across. It will now be perceived that the eggs, taken together, form
an elongated kernel, very hard and firm and coated on the sides with a thick, porous
rind, like solidified foam. Above are curved plates, set very closely and almost independent
of one another; their edges end in <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>the exit-zone, where they form a double row of small, imbricated scales.
</p>
<p>The eggs are buried in a yellow matrix of horny appearance. They are placed in layers,
shaped like segments of a circle, with the ends containing the heads converging towards
the exit-zone. This arrangement tells us how the deliverance is accomplished. The
new-born larvæ will slip into the space left between two adjoining plates, a prolongation
of the kernel, where they will find a narrow passage, difficult to go through, but
just sufficient when we bear in mind the curious provision of which we shall speak
presently; and by so doing they will reach the middle belt. Here, under the imbricated
scales, two outlets open for each layer of eggs. Half of the larvæ undergoing their
liberation will emerge through the right door, half through the left. And this is
repeated for each layer from end to end of the nest.
</p>
<p>To sum up these structural details, which are rather difficult to grasp for any one
who has not the thing in front of him: lying along the axis of the nest and shaped
like a date-stone is the cluster of eggs, grouped in layers. A protecting rind, a
sort of solidified foam, surrounds this cluster, except at the top along <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>the median line, where the frothy rind is replaced by thin plates set side by side.
The free ends of these plates form the exit-zone outside; they are imbricated in two
series of scales and leave a couple of outlets, narrow clefts, for each layer of eggs.
</p>
<p>The most striking part of my researches was being present at the construction of the
nest and seeing how the Mantis goes to work to produce so complex a building. I managed
it with some difficulty, for the laying takes place without warning and nearly always
at night. After much useless waiting, chance at last favoured me. On the 5th of September,
one of my boarders, who had been fertilized on the 29th of August, decided to lay
her eggs before my eyes at about four o’clock in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>Before watching her labour, let us note one thing: all the nests that I have obtained
in the cages—and there are a good many of them—have as their support, with not a single
exception, the wire gauze of the covers. I had taken care to place at the Mantes’
disposal a few rough bits of stone, a few tufts of thyme, foundations very often used
in the open fields. My captives preferred the wire network, whose meshes furnish <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>a perfectly safe support as the soft material of the building becomes encrusted in
them.
</p>
<p>The nests, under natural conditions, enjoy no shelter; they have to endure the inclemencies
of winter, to withstand rain, wind, frost and snow without coming loose. Therefore
the mother always chooses an uneven support for the nest, so that the foundations
can be wedged into it and a firm hold obtained. But, when circumstances permit, the
better is preferred to the middling and the best to the better; and this must be the
reason why the trelliswork of the cages is invariably adopted.
</p>
<p>The only Mantis that I have been allowed to observe while engaged in laying does her
work upside down, hanging from the top of the cage. My presence, my magnifying-glass,
my investigations do not disturb her at all, so great is her absorption in her labour.
I can raise the trellised dome, tilt it, turn it over, spin it this way and that,
without the insect’s suspending its task for a moment. I can take my forceps and lift
the long wings to see what is happening underneath. The Mantis takes no notice. Up
to this point, all is well: the mother does not move and <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>impassively endures all the indiscretions of which I am guilty as an observer. And
yet things do not go quite as I could wish, for the operation is too rapid and is
too difficult to follow.
</p>
<p>The end of the abdomen is immersed the whole time in a sea of foam, which prevents
us from grasping the details of the process with any clearness. This foam is greyish-white,
a little sticky and almost like soapsuds. When it first appears, it adheres slightly
to a straw which I dip into it, but, two minutes afterwards, it is solidified and
no longer sticks to the straw. In a very short time, its consistency is that which
we find in an old nest.
</p>
<p>The frothy mass consists mainly of air imprisoned in little bubbles. This air, which
gives the nest a volume much greater than that of the Mantis’ belly, obviously does
not come from the insect, though the foam appears at the entrance of the genital organs;
it is taken from the atmosphere. The Mantis, therefore, builds above all with air,
which is eminently suited to protect the nest against the weather. She discharges
a sticky substance, similar to the caterpillars’ silk-fluid; and with this composition,
which amalgamates <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>instantly with the outer air, she produces foam.
</p>
<p>She whips her product just as we whip white of egg to make it rise and froth. The
tip of the abdomen, opening with a long cleft, forms two lateral ladles which meet
and separate with a constant, rapid movement, beating the sticky fluid and turning
it into foam as it is discharged outside. In addition, between the two flapping ladles,
we see the internal organs rising and falling, appearing and disappearing, after the
manner of a piston-rod, without being able to distinguish their precise action, drowned
as they are in the opaque stream of foam.
</p>
<p>The end of the abdomen, ever throbbing, quickly opening and closing its valves, swings
from right to left and left to right like a pendulum. The result of each swing is
a layer of eggs inside and a transversal furrow outside. As the abdomen advances in
the arc described, suddenly and at very close intervals it dips deeper into the foam,
as though it were pushing something to the bottom of the frothy mass. Each time, no
doubt, an egg is laid; but things happen so fast and under conditions so unfavourable
to observation that I never once succeed in <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>seeing the ovipositor at work. I can judge of the arrival of the eggs only by the
movements of the tip of the abdomen, which suddenly drives down and immerses itself
more deeply.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the viscous stuff is poured forth in intermittent waves and whipped
and turned into foam by the two terminal valves. The froth obtained spreads over the
sides of the layer of eggs and at the base, where I see it, pressed back by the abdomen,
projecting through the meshes of the gauze. Thus the spongy covering is gradually
brought into being as the ovaries are emptied.
</p>
<p>I imagine, without being able to rely on direct observation, that for the central
kernel, where the eggs are contained in a more homogeneous material than the rind,
the Mantis employs her product as it is, without beating it up and making it foam.
When the eggs are deposited, the two valves would produce foam to cover them. Once
again, however, all this is very difficult to follow under the veil of the bubbling
mass.
</p>
<p>In a new nest, the exit-zone is coated with a layer of fine porous matter, of a pure,
dull, almost chalky white, which contrasts with <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>the dirty white of the remainder of the nest. It is like the composition which confectioners
make out of whipped white of egg, sugar and starch, with which to ornament their cakes.
This snowy covering is very easily crumbled and removed. When it is gone, the exit-zone
is clearly defined, with its two rows of plates with free edges. The weather, the
wind and the rain sooner or later remove it in strips and flakes; and therefore the
old nests retain no traces of it.
</p>
<p>At the first inspection, one might be tempted to look upon this snowy matter as a
different substance from the remainder of the nest. But can it be that the Mantis
really employs two different products? By no means. Anatomy, to begin with, assures
us of the unity of the materials. The organ that secretes the substance of the nest
consists of twisted cylindrical tubes, divided into two sections of twenty each. All
are filled with a colourless, viscous fluid, exactly similar in appearance wherever
we look. There is nowhere any sign of a product with a chalky colouring.
</p>
<p>The manner in which the snowy ribbon is formed also makes us reject the theory of
different materials. We see the Mantis’ two <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>caudal threads sweeping the surface of the foamy mass, skimming, so to speak, the
top of the froth, collecting it and retaining it along the back of the nest to form
a band that looks like a ribbon of icing. What remains after this sweeping, or what
trickles from the band before it sets, spreads over the sides in a thin wash of bubbles
so fine that they cannot be seen without the magnifying-glass.
</p>
<p>The surface of a muddy stream containing clay will be covered with coarse and dirty
foam, churned up by the rushing torrent. On this foam, soiled with earthy materials,
we see here and there masses of beautiful white froth, with smaller bubbles. Selection
is due to the difference in density; and so the snow-white foam in places lies on
top of the dirty foam whence it proceeds. Something similar happens when the Mantis
builds her nest. The twin ladles reduce to foam the sticky spray from the glands.
The thinnest and lightest portion, made whiter by its more delicate porousness, rises
to the surface, where the caudal threads sweep it up and gather it into a snowy ribbon
along the back of the nest.
</p>
<p>Until now, with a little patience, observation <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>has been practicable and has given satisfactory results. It becomes impossible when
we come to the very complex structure of that middle zone where exits are contrived
for the emergence of the larvæ under the shelter of a double row of imbricated plates.
The little that I am able to make out amounts to this: the tip of the abdomen, split
wide from top to bottom, forms a sort of button-hole whose upper end remains almost
fixed while the lower end, in swinging, produces foam and immerses eggs in it. It
is that upper end which is undoubtedly responsible for the work of the middle zone.
I always see it in the extension of that zone, in the midst of the fine white foam
collected by the caudal filaments. These, one on the right, the other on the left,
mark the boundaries of the band. They feel its edges; they seem to be testing the
work. I can easily imagine them two long and exquisitely delicate fingers controlling
the difficult business of construction.
</p>
<p>But how are the two rows of scales obtained and the fissures, the exit-doors, which
they shelter? I do not know. I cannot even guess. I leave the rest of the problem
to others.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>What a wonderful mechanism is this which emits so methodically and swiftly the horny
matrix of the central kernel, the protecting froth, the white foam of the median ribbon,
the eggs and the fertilizing fluid and which at the same time is able to build overlapping
plates, imbricated scales and alternating open fissures! We are lost in admiration.
And yet how easily the work is done! The Mantis hangs motionless on the wire gauze
which is the foundation of her nest. She gives not a glance at the edifice that is
rising behind her; her legs are not called upon for assistance of any kind. The thing
works of itself. We have here not an industrial task requiring the cunning of instinct;
it is a purely automatic process, regulated by the insect’s tools and organization.
The nest, with its highly complicated structure, proceeds solely from the play of
the organs, even as in our own industries we manufacture by machinery a host of objects
whose perfection would outwit our manual dexterity.
</p>
<p>From another point of view, the Mantis’ nest is more remarkable still. We see in it
a superb application of one of the most beautiful principles of physics, that of the
conservation <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>of heat. The Mantis anticipated us in a knowledge of non-conducting bodies.
</p>
<p>We owe to Rumford,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2042src" href="#xd31e2042">2</a> the natural philosopher, the following curious experiment, which fittingly demonstrates
the low conductivity of the air. The illustrious scientist dropped a frozen cheese
into a mass of foam supplied by well-beaten eggs. The whole was subjected to the heat
of an oven. The result in a short time was an <i lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i> hot enough to burn the tongue, with the cheese in the middle as cold as at the beginning.
The air contained in the bubbles of the surrounding froth explains the strange phenomenon.
As an exceedingly poor thermal conductor, it had arrested the heat of the oven and
prevented it from reaching the frozen substance in the centre.
</p>
<p>Now what does the Mantis do? Precisely the same as Rumford: she whips her white of
egg into an <i lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i>, to protect the eggs collected into a central kernel. Her aim, it is true, is reversed:
her coagulated foam is intended to ward off the cold, not the heat. But a protection
against <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>one is a protection against the other; and the ingenious physicist, had he wished,
could easily with the same frothy wrapper have maintained the heat of a body in cold
surroundings.
</p>
<p>Rumford knew the secrets of the stratum of air thanks to the accumulated knowledge
of his ancestors, his own researches and his own studies. How is it that for no one
knows how many centuries the Mantis has beaten our natural philosophers in the matter
of this delicate problem of heat? How did she come to think of wrapping a blanket
of foam around her mass of eggs, which, fixed without any shelter to a twig or stone,
has to endure the rigours of winter with impunity?
</p>
<p>The other Mantidæ of my neighbourhood, the only ones of whom I can speak with full
knowledge, use the non-conducting wrapper of solidified foam or do without it, according
as the eggs are destined to live through the winter or not. The little Grey Mantis,
who differs so greatly from the other owing to the almost entire absence of wings
in the female, builds a nest not quite so big as a cherry-stone and covers it very
cleverly with a rind of froth. Why this beaten-up envelope? <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>Because the nest of the Grey Mantis, like that of the Praying Mantis, has to last
through the winter, exposed on its bough or stone to all the dangers of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, in spite of her size, which is equal to that of the Praying Mantis,
<i lang="la">Empusa pauperata</i>, who is the most curious of our insects, builds a nest as small as that of the Grey
Mantis. It is a very modest edifice, consisting of a small number of cells set side
by side in three or four rows joined together. Here there is no frothy envelope at
all, though the nest, like those mentioned above, is fixed in an exposed situation
on some twig or broken stone. This absence of a non-conducting mattress points to
a difference in climatic conditions. The Empusa’s eggs, in fact, hatch soon after
they are laid, during the fine weather. Not having to undergo the inclemencies of
winter, they have no protection but the slender sheath of their cases.
</p>
<p>Are these scrupulous and rational precautions, which rival Rumford’s <i lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i>, a casual result, one of those numberless combinations turned out by the wheel of
fortune? If so, let us not shrink from any absurdity, but recognize straightway that
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>blindness of chance is endowed with marvellous foresight.
</p>
<p>The blunt end of the nest is the first part built by the Praying Mantis and the tapering
end the last. The latter is often prolonged into a sort of spur made by drawing out
the final drop of albuminous fluid used. To complete the whole thing demands about
two hours of concentrated work, free from interruption.
</p>
<p>As soon as the laying is finished, the mother withdraws, callously. I expected to
see her return and display some tender feeling for the cradle of her family. But there
is not the least sign of maternal joy. The work is done and possesses no further interest
for her. Some Locusts have come up. One even perches on the nest. The Mantis pays
no attention to the intruders. They are peaceful, it is true. Would she drive them
away if they were dangerous and if they looked like ripping open the egg-casket? Her
impassive behaviour answers no. What is the nest to her henceforth? She knows it no
more.
</p>
<p>I have spoken of the repeated coupling of the Praying Mantis and of the tragic end
of the male, who is nearly always devoured like <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>an ordinary piece of game. In the space of a fortnight I have seen the same female
marry again as many as seven times over. Each time the easily-consoled widow ate up
her mate. Such habits make one assume repeated layings; and these do, in fact, take
place, though they are not the general rule. Among my mothers, some gave me only one
nest; others supplied me with two, both equally large. The most fertile produced three,
of which the first two were of normal size, while the third was reduced to half the
usual dimensions.
</p>
<p>The last-mentioned insect shall tell us the population which the Mantis’ ovaries are
capable of producing. Reckoning by the transversal furrows of the nest, we can easily
count the layers of eggs. These are more or less rich according to their position
at the middle of the ellipsoid or at the ends. The numbers of the eggs in the biggest
and in the smallest layer furnish an average from which we can approximately deduce
the total. In this way I find that a good-sized nest contains about four hundred eggs.
The mother with the three nests, the last of which was only half the size of the others,
therefore left as her offspring no fewer than a thousand <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>germs; those who laid twice left eight hundred; and the less fertile mothers three
to four hundred. In every case, it is a fine family, which would even become cumbrous,
if it were not subjected to drastic pruning.
</p>
<p>The pretty little Grey Mantis is much less lavish. In my cages she lays only once;
and her nest contains some sixty eggs at most. Although built on the same principles
and likewise fixed in the open, it differs remarkably from the work of the Praying
Mantis, first in its scanty dimensions and next in certain details of structure. It
is shaped like a shelving ridge. The two sides are curved and the median line projects
into a slightly denticulated crest. It is grooved crosswise by about a dozen furrows,
corresponding with the several layers of eggs. Here we find no exit-zone, with short,
imbricated scales; no snowy ribbon with alternating outlets. The whole surface, including
the foundation, is uniformly covered with a shiny red-brown rind, in which the bubbles
are very small. One end is ogival in shape; the other, the end where the nest finishes,
is abruptly truncated and is prolonged above in a short spur. The whole forms a kernel
surrounded by the foamy rind. Like the Praying <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>Mantis, the Grey Mantis works at night, an unfortunate circumstance for the observer.
</p>
<p>Large in size, curious in build and moreover plainly visible on its stone or its bit
of brushwood, the Praying Mantis’ nest could not fail to attract the attention of
the Provençal peasant. It is, in fact, very well-known in the country districts, where
it bears the name of <i>tigno</i>; it even enjoys a great reputation. Yet nobody seems to be aware of its origin. It
is always a matter for surprise to my rustic neighbours when I inform them that the
famous <i>tigno</i> is the nest of the common <i lang="fr">Prègo-Diéu</i>. Their ignorance might well be due to the Mantis’ habit of laying her eggs at night.
The insect has never been caught working at her nest in the mysterious darkness; and
the link between the worker and the work is missing, though both are known to every
one in the village.
</p>
<p>No matter: the singular object exists; it attracts the eye, it captivates the attention.
It must therefore be good for something, it must possess virtues. Thus, throughout
the ages, have the ingenuous argued, hoping to find in the unfamiliar an alleviation
of their pains.
</p>
<p>By general consent, the rural pharmacopœia, <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>in Provence, extols the <i>tigno</i> as the best remedy against chilblains. The way to employ it is exceedingly simple.
You cut the thing in two, squeeze it and rub the afflicted part with the streaming
juice. The remedy, they say, works like a charm. Every one mad with the itching of
blue and swollen fingers hastens to have recourse to the <i>tigno</i>, according to traditional custom. Does he really obtain relief?
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the unanimous conviction, I venture to doubt it, after the fruitless
experiments tried upon myself and other members of my household during the winter
of 1895, when the long and severe frost produced any amount of epidermic discomfort.
Not one of us, when smeared with the celebrated ointment, saw the chilblains on his
fingers decrease nor felt the irritation relieved in the slightest degree by the albuminous
varnish of the crushed <i>tigno</i>. It seems probable that others are no more successful and that the popular reputation
of the specific nevertheless survives, probably because of a mere identity of name
between the remedy and the disease: the Provençal for chilblain is <i>tigno</i>. Once that the nest of the Praying Mantis and the chilblain are <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>known by the same name, do not the virtues of the former become obvious? That is how
reputations are created.
</p>
<p>In my village and no doubt for some distance around, the <i>tigno</i>—I am now speaking of the Mantis’ nest—is also highly praised as a wonderful cure
for toothache. As long as you have it on you, you need never fear that trouble. Our
housewives gather it under a favourable moon; they preserve it religiously in a corner
of the press; they sew it into their pocket, lest they should lose it when taking
out their handkerchief; and neighbours borrow it when tortured by some molar.
</p>
<p>“Lend me your <i>tigno</i>: I am in agony,” says the sufferer with the swollen face.
</p>
<p>The other hastens to unstitch and to hand over the precious object:
</p>
<p>“Don’t lose it, whatever you do,” she impresses on her friend. “It’s the only one
I have; and this isn’t the right time of moon.”
</p>
<p>Let us not laugh at this eccentric toothache-nostrum: many remedies that sprawl triumphantly
over the back pages of the newspapers are no more effective. Besides, this rural simplicity
is surpassed by some old books in which slumbers the <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>science of by-gone days. An English naturalist of the sixteenth century, Thomas Moffett,
the physician,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2129src" href="#xd31e2129">3</a> tells us that, if a child lose his way in the country, he will ask the Mantis to
put him on his road. The Mantis, adds the author, “will stretch out one of her feet
and shew him the right way and seldome or never misse.” These charming things are
told with adorable simplicity:
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">“<i>Tam divina censetur bestiola, ut puero interroganti de via, extento digito rectam
monstrat atque raro vel nunquam fallat.</i>”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Where did the credulous scholar get this pretty story? Not in England, where the Mantis
cannot live; not in Provence, where we find no trace of the boyish question. All said,
I prefer the spiflicating virtues of the <i>tigno</i> to the old naturalist’s imaginings.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MANTIS: HER HATCHING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The eggs of the Praying Mantis usually hatch in bright sunshine, at about ten o’clock
on a mid-June morning. The median band or exit-zone is the only portion of the nest
that affords an outlet to the youngsters.
</p>
<p>From under each scale of that zone we see slowly appearing a blunt, transparent protuberance,
followed by two large black specks, which are the eyes. Softly the new-born grub slips
under the thin plate and half-releases itself. Is it the little Mantis in his larval
form, so nearly allied to that of the adult? Not yet. It is a transition organism.
The head is opalescent, blunt, swollen, with palpitations caused by the flow of the
blood. The rest is tinted reddish-yellow. It is quite easy to distinguish, under a
general overall, the large black eyes clouded by the veil that covers them, the mouth-parts
flattened against the chest, the legs plastered to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>body from front to back. Altogether, with the exception of the very obvious legs,
the whole thing, with its big blunt head, its eyes, its delicate abdominal segmentation
and its boatlike shape, reminds us somewhat of the first state of the Cicadæ on leaving
the egg, a state which is pictured exactly by a tiny, finless fish.
</p>
<p>Here then is a second instance of an organization of very brief duration having as
its function to bring into the light of day, through narrow and difficult passes,
a microscopic creature whose limbs, if free, would, because of their length, be an
insurmountable impediment. To enable him to emerge from the exiguous tunnel of his
twig, a tunnel bristling with woody fibres and blocked with shells already empty,
the Cicada is born swathed in bands and endowed with a boat shape, which is eminently
suited to slipping easily through an awkward passage. The young Mantis is exposed
to similar difficulties. He has to emerge from the depths of the nest through narrow,
winding ways, in which full-spread, slender limbs would not be able to find room.
The high stilts, the murderous harpoons, the delicate antennæ, organs which will be
most useful presently, in <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>the brushwood, would now hinder the emergence, would make it very laborious, impossible.
The creature therefore comes into existence swaddled and furthermore takes the shape
of a boat.
</p>
<p>The case of the Cicada and the Mantis opens up a new vein to us in the inexhaustible
entomological mine. I extract from it a law which other and similar facts, picked
up more or less everywhere, will certainly not fail to confirm. The true larva is
not always the direct product of the egg. When the newborn grub is likely to experience
special difficulties in effecting its deliverance, an accessory organism, which I
shall continue to call the primary larva, precedes the genuine larval state and has
as its function to bring to the light of day the tiny creature which is incapable
of releasing itself.
</p>
<p>To go on with our story, the primary larvæ show themselves under the thin plates of
the exit-zone. A vigorous flow of humours occurs in the head, swelling it out and
converting it into a diaphanous and ever-throbbing blister. In this way the splitting-apparatus
is prepared. At the same time, the little creature, half-caught under its scale, sways,
pushes forward, draws back. Each <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>swaying is accompanied by an increase of the swelling in the head. At last the prothorax
arches and the head is bent low towards the chest. The tunic bursts across the prothorax.
The little animal tugs, wriggles, sways, bends and straightens itself again. The legs
are drawn from their sheaths; the antennæ, two long parallel threads, are likewise
released. The creature is now fastened to the nest only by a worn-out cord. A few
shakes complete the deliverance.
</p>
<p>We here have the insect in its genuine larval form. All that remains behind is a sort
of irregular cord, a shapeless clout which the least breath blows about like a flimsy
bit of fluff. It is the exit-tunic violently shed and reduced to a mere rag.
</p>
<p>For all my watchfulness, I missed the moment of hatching in the case of the Grey Mantis.
The little that I know is reduced to this: at the end of the spur or promontory with
which the nest finishes in front is a small, dull-white speck, formed of very powdery
foam. This round pore is only just plugged with a frothy stopper and constitutes the
sole outlet from the nest, which is thoroughly strengthened at every other part. It
takes <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>the place of the long band of scales through which the Praying Mantis is released.
It is here that the youngsters must emerge one by one from their casket. Chance does
not favour me and I do not witness the exodus, but, soon after the family has come
forth, I see dangling at the entrance to the liberating pore a shapeless bunch of
white cast-off clothes, thin skins which a puff of wind would disperse. These are
the garments flung aside by the young as they make their appearance in the open air;
and they testify to the presence of a transition wrapper which permits of movement
inside the maze of the nest. The Grey Mantis therefore also has her primary larva,
which packs itself up in a narrow sheath, conducive to escape. The period of this
emergence is June.
</p>
<p>To return to the Praying Mantis. The hatching does not take place all over the nest
at one time, but rather in sections, in successive swarms which may be separated by
intervals of two days or more. The pointed end, containing the last eggs, usually
begins. This inversion of chronological order, calling the last to the light of day
before the first, may well be due to the shape of the nest. The thin end, which is
more accessible <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>to the stimulus of a fine day, wakes up before the blunt end, which is larger and
does not so soon acquire the necessary amount of heat.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, although still broken up in swarms, the hatching embraces the
whole length of the exit-zone. A striking sight indeed is the sudden exodus of a hundred
young Mantes. Hardly does the tiny creature show its black eyes under a scale before
others appear instantly, in their numbers. It is as though a certain shock were being
communicated from one to another, as though an awakening signal were transmitted,
so swiftly does the hatching spread all round. Almost in a moment the median band
is covered with young Mantes who run about feverishly, stripping themselves of their
rent garments.
</p>
<p>The nimble little creatures do not stay long on the nest. They let themselves drop
off or else clamber into the nearest foliage. All is over in less than twenty minutes.
The common cradle resumes its peaceful condition, prior to furnishing a new legion
a few days later; and so on until all the eggs are finished.
</p>
<p>I have witnessed this exodus as often as <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>I wished to, either out of doors, in my enclosure, where I had deposited in sunny
places the nests gathered more or less everywhere during my winter leisure, or else
in the seclusion of a greenhouse, where I thought, in my simplicity, that I should
be better able to protect the budding family. I have witnessed the hatching twenty
times if I have once; and I have always beheld a scene of unforgetable carnage. The
round-bellied Mantis may procreate germs by the thousands: she will never have enough
to cope with the devourers who are destined to decimate the breed from the moment
that it leaves the egg.
</p>
<p>The Ants above all are zealous exterminators. Daily I surprise their ill-omened visits
on my rows of nests. It is vain for me to intervene, however seriously; their assiduity
never slackens. They seldom succeed in making a breach in the fortress: that is too
difficult; but, greedy of the dainty flesh in course of formation inside, they await
a favourable opportunity, they lie in wait for the exit.
</p>
<p>Despite my daily watchfulness, they are there the moment that the young Mantes appear.
They grab them by the abdomen, pull <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>them out of their sheaths, cut them up. You see a piteous fray between tender babes
gesticulating as their only means of defence and ferocious brigands carrying their
<i lang="la">spolia opima</i> at the end of their mandibles. In less than no time the massacre of the innocents
is consummated; and all that remains of the flourishing family is a few scattered
survivors who have escaped by accident.
</p>
<p>The future assassin, the scourge of the insect race, the terror of the Locust on the
brushwood, the dread devourer of fresh meat, is herself devoured, from her birth,
by one of the least of that race, the Ant. The ogress, prolific to excess, sees her
family thinned by the dwarf. But the slaughter is not long continued. So soon as she
has acquired a little firmness from the air and strengthened her legs, the Mantis
ceases to be attacked. She trots about briskly among the Ants, who fall back as she
passes, no longer daring to tackle her. With her grappling-legs brought close to her
chest, like arms ready for self-defence, already she strikes awe into them by her
proud bearing.
</p>
<p>A second connoisseur in tender meats pays no heed to these threats. This is the little
Grey Lizard, the lover of sunny walls. Apprised <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>I know not how of the quarry, here he comes, picking up one by one, with the tip of
his slender tongue, the stray insects that have escaped the Ants. They make a small
mouthful but an exquisite one, so it seems, to judge by the blinking of the reptile’s
eye. For each little wretch gulped down, its lid half-closes, a sign of profound satisfaction.
I drive away the bold Lizard who ventures to perpetrate his raid before my eyes. He
comes back again and, this time, pays dearly for his rashness. If I let him have his
way, I should have nothing left.
</p>
<p>Is this all? Not yet. Another ravager, the smallest of all but not the least formidable,
has anticipated the Lizard and the Ant. This is a very tiny Hymenopteron armed with
a probe, a Chalcis, who establishes her eggs in the newly-built nest. The Mantis’
brood shares the fate of the Cicada’s: parasitic vermin attack the eggs and empty
the shells. Out of all that I have collected I often obtain nothing or hardly anything.
The Chalcis has been that way.
</p>
<p>Let us gather up what the various exterminators, known or unknown, have left me. When
newly hatched, the larva is of a pale hue, white faintly tinged with yellow. <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>The swelling of its head soon diminishes and disappears. Its colour is not long in
darkening and turns light-brown within twenty-four hours. The little Mantis very nimbly
lifts up her grappling-legs, opens and closes them; she turns her head to right and
left; she curls her abdomen. The fully-developed larva has no greater litheness and
agility. For a few minutes the family stops where it is, swarming over the nest; then
it scatters at random on the ground and the plants hard by.
</p>
<p>I instal a few dozen emigrants under bell-covers. On what shall I feed these future
huntresses? On game, obviously. But what game? To these miniature creatures I can
only offer atoms. I serve them up a rose-branch covered with Green Fly. The plump
Aphis, a tender morsel suited to my feeble guests, is utterly scorned. Not one of
the captives touches it.
</p>
<p>I try them with Midges, the smallest that chance flings into my net as it sweeps the
grass, and meet with the same obstinate refusal. I offer them pieces of Fly, hung
here and there on the gauze of the cover. None accepts my quarters of venison. Perhaps
the Locust will tempt them, the Locust on <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>whom the adult Mantis dotes? A prolonged and minute search places me in possession
of what I want. This time the bill of fare will consist of a few recently hatched
Acridians. Young as they are, they have already reached the size of my charges. Will
the little Mantes fancy these? They do not fancy them: at the sight of their tiny
prey they run away dismayed.
</p>
<p>Then what do you want? What other game do you find on your native brushwood? I can
see nothing. Can you have some special infants’ food, vegetarian perhaps? Let us even
try the improbable. The very tenderest bit of the heart of a lettuce is declined.
So are the different sorts of grass which I tax my ingenuity in varying; so are the
drops of honey which I place on spikes of lavender. All my endeavours come to nothing;
and my captives die of inanition.
</p>
<p>My failure has its lessons. It seems to point to a transition diet which I have not
been able to discover. Long ago, the larvæ of the Oil-beetles gave me a great deal
of trouble, before I knew that they want as their first food the egg of the Bee whose
store of honey they will afterwards consume. Perhaps the young Mantes also in the
beginning <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>demand a special pap, something more in keeping with their frailty. Despite its resolute
air, I do not quite see the feeble little creature hunting. The game, whatever it
be, kicks out, when attacked, frisks about, defends itself; and the assailant is not
yet in a condition to ward off even the flap of a Midge’s wing. Then what does it
feed on? I should not be surprised if there were interesting facts to be picked up
in this baby-food question.
</p>
<p>These fastidious ones, so difficult to provide with nourishment, meet with even more
pitiful deaths than hunger. When only just born, they fall a prey to the Ant, the
Lizard and other ravagers who lie in wait, patiently, for the exquisite provender
to hatch. The egg itself is not respected. An infinitesimal perforator inserts her
own eggs in the nest through the barrier of solidified foam, thus settling her offspring,
which, maturing earlier, nips the Mantis’ family in the bud. How many are called and
how few are chosen! There were a thousand of them perhaps, sprung from one mother
who was capable of giving birth to three broods. One couple alone escapes extermination,
one alone keeps up the breed, seeing that the number remains <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>more or less the same from year to year.
</p>
<p>Here a serious question arises. Can the Mantis have acquired her present fecundity
by degrees? Can she, as the ravages of the Ant and others reduced her progeny, have
increased the output of her ovaries so as to make up for excessive destruction by
excessive production? Could the enormous brood of to-day be due to the wastage of
former days? So think some, who are ready, without convincing proofs, to see in animals
even more profound changes brought about by circumstances.
</p>
<p>In front of my window, on the sloping margin of the pond, stands a magnificent cherry-tree.
It came there by accident, a sturdy wilding, disregarded by my predecessors and to-day
respected far more for its spreading branches than for its fruit, which is of very
indifferent quality. In April it forms a splendid white-satin dome. Its blossoms are
as snow; their fallen petals carpet the ground. Soon the red cherries appear in profusion.
O my beautiful tree, how lavish you are and what a number of baskets you will fill!
</p>
<p>And for this reason what revelry up <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>above! The Sparrow is the first to hear of the ripe cherries and comes trooping, morning
and evening, to pilfer and squall; he informs his friends in the neighbourhood, the
Greenfinch and the Warbler, who hasten up and banquet for weeks on end. Butterflies
flit from one nibbled cherry to another, taking delicious sips at each. Rose-chafers
bite great mouthfuls out of the fruit, then fall asleep sated. Wasps and Hornets burst
open the sweet caskets; and the Gnats follow to get drunk in their wake. A plump maggot,
settled in the very centre of the pulp, blissfully feasts upon its juicy dwelling-house
and waxes big and fat. It will rise from table to change into a comely Fly.
</p>
<p>On the ground there are others at the banquet. A host of footpads is battening on
the fallen cherries. At night, the Field-mice come gathering the stones stripped by
the Wood-lice, Earwigs, Ants and Slugs; they hoard them in their burrows. During the
long winter they will make holes in them to extract and nibble the kernels. A numberless
throng lives upon the generous cherry-tree.
</p>
<p>What would the tree require to provide a successor one day and maintain its species
<span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>in a state of harmonious and well-balanced prosperity? A single seed would be enough;
and every year it gives forth bushels and bushels. Tell me why, please.
</p>
<p>Shall we say that the cherry-tree, at first very economical with its fruit, became
lavish by degrees in order thus to escape its multitudinous ravagers? Shall we say
of the tree, as we said of the Mantis, that excessive destruction gradually induced
excessive production? Who would dare to venture on such rash statements? Is it not
perfectly obvious that the cherry-tree is one of those factories in which elements
are wrought into organic matter, one of those laboratories in which the dead thing
is changed into the thing fitted to live? No doubt, cherries ripen that they may be
perpetuated; but these are the minority, the very small minority. If all seeds were
to sprout and to develop fully, there would long ago have been no room on the earth
for the cherry-tree alone. The vast majority of its fruits fulfil another function.
They serve as food for a crowd of living creatures, who are not skilled as the plant
is in the transcendental chemistry that turns the uneatable into the eatable.
</p>
<p>Matter, in order to serve in the highest <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>manifestations of life, must undergo slow and most delicate elaboration. That elaboration
begins in the workshop of the infinitely small, of the microbe, for instance, one
of which, more powerful than the lightning’s might, combines oxygen and nitrogen and
produces nitrates, the primary food of plants. It begins on the confines of nothingness,
is improved in the vegetal, is yet further refined in the animal and step by step
attains the substance of the brain.
</p>
<p>How many hidden labourers, how many unknown manipulators worked perhaps for centuries,
first at getting the rough ore and then at the refining of that grey matter which
becomes the brain, the most marvellous of the implements of the mind, even if it were
capable only of making us say:
</p>
<p>“Two and two are four!”
</p>
<p>The rocket, when rising, reserves for the culminating point of its ascent the dazzling
fountain of its many-coloured lights. Then all is dark again. Its smoke, its gases,
its oxides will, in the long run, be able to reconstitute other explosives by vegetable
processes. Even so does matter act in its metamorphoses. From stage to stage, from
one delicate refinement to another yet more delicate, <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>it succeeds in attaining heights where the splendours of the intellect shine forth
through its agency; then, shattered by the effort, it relapses into the nameless thing
whence it started, into scattered molecules which are the common origin of living
things.
</p>
<p>At the head of the assemblers of organic matter stands the plant, the animal’s senior.
Directly or indirectly, it is to-day, as it was in the geological period, the chief
purveyor to beings more generously endowed with life. In the laboratory of its cell
the food of the universe at least gets its first rough preparation. Comes the animal,
which corrects the preparation, improves it and transmits it to others of a higher
order. Cropped grass becomes mutton; and mutton becomes human flesh or Wolf-flesh,
according to the consumer.
</p>
<p>Among those elaborators of nourishing atoms which do not create organic matter out
of any- and everything, starting with the mineral, as the plant does, the most prolific
are the fishes, the first-born of vertebrate animals. Ask the Cod what she does with
her millions of eggs. Her answer will be that of the beech with its myriads of nuts,
or the oak with its myriads of acorns. She <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>is immensely fruitful in order to feed an immense number of the hungry. She is continuing
the work which her predecessors performed in remote ages, when nature, not as yet
rich in organic matter, hastened to increase her reserves of life by bestowing prodigious
exuberance upon her primeval workers.
</p>
<p>The Mantis, like the fish, dates back to those distant epochs. Her strange shape and
her uncouth habits have told us so. The richness of her ovaries confirms it. She retains
in her entrails a feeble relic of the procreative fury that prevailed in olden times
under the dank shade of the arborescent ferns; she contributes, in a very humble but
none the less real measure, to the sublime alchemy of living things.
</p>
<p>Let us look closely at her work. The grass grows thick and green, drawing its nourishment
from the earth. The Locust crops it. The Mantis makes a meal of the Locust and swells
out with eggs, which are laid, in three batches, to the number of a thousand. When
they hatch, up comes the Ant and levies an enormous tribute on the brood. We appear
to be retroceding. In vastness of bulk, yes; in refinement of instinct, <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>certainly not. In this respect how far superior is the Ant to the Mantis! Besides,
the cycle of possible happenings is not closed.
</p>
<p>Young Ants still contained in their cocoon—popularly known as Ants’-eggs—form the
food on which the Pheasant’s brood is reared. These are domestic poultry just as much
as the Pullet and the Capon, but their keep makes greater demands on the owner’s care
and purse. When it grows big, this poultry is let loose in the woods; and people calling
themselves civilized take the greatest pleasure in bringing down with their guns the
poor creatures which have lost the instinct of self-preservation in the pheasantries,
or, to speak plainly, in the poultry-yard. You cut the throat of the Chicken required
for roasting; you shoot, with all the parade of sport, that other Chicken, the Pheasant.
I fail to understand those insensate massacres.
</p>
<p>Tartarin of Tarascon, in the absence of game, used to shoot at his cap. I prefer that.
And above all I prefer the hunting, real hunting, of another fervent consumer of Ants,
the Wryneck, the <i>Tiro-lengo</i> of the Provençaux, so-called because of his scientific method of darting his immensely-long
<span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>and sticky tongue across a procession of Ants and then suddenly withdrawing it all
black with the limed insects. With such mouthfuls as these, the Wryneck becomes disgracefully
fat in autumn; he plasters himself with butter on his rump and sides and under his
wings; he hangs a string of it round his neck; he pads his skull with it right down
to the beak.
</p>
<p>He is then delicious, roasted: small, I admit; no bigger than a Lark, at the outside;
but, small though he be, unlike anything else and immeasurably superior to the Pheasant,
who must begin to go bad before developing a flavour at all.
</p>
<p>Let me for this once do justice to the merit of the humblest! When the table is cleared
after the evening meal and all is quiet and my body relieved for the time being of
its physiological needs, sometimes I succeed in picking up, here and there, a good
idea or two; and it may well be that the Mantis, the Locust, the Ant and even lesser
creatures contribute to these sudden gleams of light which flash unaccountably into
one’s mind. By strange and devious paths, they have all supplied, in their respective
ways, the drop of oil that feeds the lamp of thought. Their energies, slowly developed,
stored up and <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>handed down by predecessors, become infused into our veins and sustain our weakness.
We live by their death.
</p>
<p>To conclude. The Mantis, prolific to excess, in her turn makes organic matter, bequeathing
it to the Ant, who bequeaths it to the Wryneck, who bequeaths it perhaps to man. She
procreates a thousand, partly to perpetuate her species, but far more than she may
contribute, according to her means, to the general picnic of the living. She brings
us back to the ancient symbol of the Serpent biting its own tail. The world is an
endless circle: everything finishes so that everything may begin again; everything
dies so that everything may live.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE EMPUSA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sea, life’s first foster-mother, still preserves in her depths many of those singular
and incongruous shapes which were the earliest attempts of the animal kingdom; the
land, less fruitful, but with more capacity for progress, has almost wholly lost the
strange forms of other days. The few that remain belong especially to the series of
primitive insects, insects exceedingly limited in their industrial powers and subject
to very summary metamorphoses, if to any at all. In my district, in the front rank
of those entomological anomalies which remind us of the denizens of the old coal-forests,
stand the Mantidæ, including the Praying Mantis, so curious in habits and structure.
Here also is the Empusa (<i lang="la">E. pauperata</i>, <span class="sc">Latr.</span>), the subject of this chapter.
</p>
<p>Her larva is certainly the strangest creature among the terrestrial fauna of Provence:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>a slim, swaying thing of so fantastic an appearance that uninitiated fingers dare
not lay hold of it. The children of my neighbourhood, impressed by its startling shape,
call it “the Devilkin.” In their imaginations, the queer little creature savours of
witchcraft. One comes across it, though always sparsely, in spring, up to May; in
autumn; and sometimes in winter, if the sun be strong. The tough grasses of the wastelands,
the stunted bushes which catch the sun and are sheltered from the wind by a few heaps
of stones are the chilly Empusa’s favourite abode.
</p>
<p>Let us give a rapid sketch of her. The abdomen, which always curls up so as to join
the back, spreads paddlewise and twists into a crook. Pointed scales, a sort of foliaceous
expansions arranged in three rows, cover the lower surface, which becomes the upper
surface because of the crook aforesaid. The scaly crook is propped on four long, thin
stilts, on four legs armed with knee-pieces, that is to say, carrying at the end of
the thigh, where it joins the shin, a curved, projecting blade not unlike that of
a cleaver.
</p>
<p>Above this base, this four-legged stool, rises, at a sudden angle, the stiff corselet,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>disproportionately long and almost perpendicular. The end of this bust, round and
slender as a straw, carries the hunting-trap, the grappling limbs, copied from those
of the Mantis. They consist of a terminal harpoon, sharper than a needle, and a cruel
vice, with jaws toothed like a saw. The jaw formed by the arm proper is hollowed into
a groove and carries on either side five long spikes, with smaller indentations in
between. The jaw formed by the fore-arm is similarly furrowed, but its double saw,
which fits into the groove of the upper arm when at rest, is formed of finer, closer
and more regular teeth. The magnifying-glass reveals a score of equal points in each
row. The machine only lacks size to be a fearful implement of torture.
</p>
<p>The head is in keeping with this arsenal. What a queer-shaped head it is! A pointed
face, with walrus moustaches furnished by the palpi; large goggle eyes; between them,
a dirk, a halberd blade; and, on the forehead, a mad, unheard-of thing: a sort of
tall mitre, an extravagant head-dress that juts forward, spreading right and left
into peaked wings and cleft along the top. What does the Devilkin want with that monstrous
<span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>pointed cap, than which no wise man of the East, no astrologer of old ever wore a
more splendiferous? This we shall learn when we see her out hunting.
</p>
<p>The dress is commonplace; grey tints predominate. Towards the end of the larval period,
after a few moultings, it begins to give a glimpse of the adult’s richer livery and
becomes striped, still very faintly, with pale-green, white and pink. Already the
two sexes are distinguished by their antennæ. Those of the future mothers are thread-like;
those of the future males are distended into a spindle at the lower half, forming
a case or sheath whence graceful plumes will spring at a later date.
</p>
<p>Behold the creature, worthy of a Callot’s<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2292src" href="#xd31e2292">1</a> fantastic pencil. If you come across it in the bramble-bushes, it sways upon its
four stilts, it wags its head, it looks at you with a knowing air, it twists its mitre
round and peers over its shoulder. You seem to read mischief in its pointed face.
You try to take hold of it. The imposing attitude ceases forthwith, the raised corselet
is lowered and <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>the creature makes off with mighty strides, helping itself along with its fighting-limbs,
which clutch the twigs. The flight need not last long, if you have a practised eye.
The Empusa is captured, put into a screw of paper, which will save her frail limbs
from sprains, and lastly penned in a wire-gauze cage. In this way, in October, I obtain
a flock sufficient for my purpose.
</p>
<p>How to feed them? My Devilkins are very little; they are a month or two old at most.
I give them Locusts suited to their size, the smallest that I can find. They refuse
them. Nay more, they are frightened of them. Should a thoughtless Locust meekly approach
one of the Empusæ, suspended by her four hind-legs to the trellised dome, the intruder
meets with a bad reception. The pointed mitre is lowered; and an angry thrust sends
him rolling. We have it: the wizard’s cap is a defensive weapon, a protective crest.
The Ram charges with his forehead, the Empusa butts with her mitre.
</p>
<p>But this does not mean dinner. I serve up the House-fly, alive. She is accepted, without
hesitation. The moment that the Fly comes within reach, the watchful Devilkin turns
her head, bends the stalk of her <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>corselet slantwise and, flinging out her forelimb, harpoons the Fly and grips her
between her two saws. No Cat pouncing upon a Mouse could be quicker.
</p>
<p>The game, however small, is enough for a meal. It is enough for the whole day, often
for several days. This is my first surprise: the extreme abstemiousness of these savagely-armed
insects. I was prepared for ogres: I find ascetics satisfied with a meagre collation
at rare intervals. A Fly fills their belly for twenty-four hours at least.
</p>
<p>Thus passes the late autumn: the Empusæ, more and more temperate from day to day,
hang motionless from the wire gauze. Their natural abstinence is my best ally, for
Flies grow scarce; and a time comes when I should be hard put to it to keep the menageries
supplied with provisions.
</p>
<p>During the three winter months, nothing stirs. From time to time, on fine days, I
expose the cage to the sun’s rays, in the window. Under the influence of this heat-bath,
the captives stretch their legs a little, sway from side to side, make up their minds
to move about, but without displaying any awakening appetite. The rare Midges that
fall to my assiduous efforts do not appear to <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>tempt them. It is a rule for them to spend the cold season in a state of complete
abstinence.
</p>
<p>My cages tell me what must happen outside, during the winter. Ensconced in the crannies
of the rockwork, in the sunniest places, the young Empusæ wait, in a state of torpor,
for the return of the hot weather. Notwithstanding the shelter of a heap of stones,
there must be painful moments when the frost is prolonged and the snow penetrates
little by little into the best-protected crevices. No matter: hardier than they look,
the refugees escape the dangers of the winter season. Sometimes, when the sun is strong,
they venture out of their hiding-place and come to see if spring be nigh.
</p>
<p>Spring comes. We are in March. My prisoners bestir themselves, change their skin.
They need victuals. My catering difficulties recommence. The House-fly, so easy to
catch, is lacking in these days. I fall back upon earlier Diptera: Eristales, or Drone-flies.
The Empusa refuses them. They are too big for her and can offer too strenuous a resistance.
She wards off their approach with blows of her mitre.
</p>
<p>A few tender morsels, in the shape of very <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>young Grasshoppers, are readily accepted. Unfortunately, such wind-falls do not often
find their way into my sweeping-net. Abstinence becomes obligatory until the arrival
of the first Butterflies. Henceforth, <i lang="la">Pieris brassicæ</i>, the White Cabbage Butterfly, will contribute the greater portion of the victuals.
</p>
<p>Let loose in the wire cage, the Pieris is regarded as excellent game. The Empusa lies
in wait for her, seizes her, but releases her at once, lacking the strength to overpower
her. The Cabbage Butterfly’s great wings, beating the air, give her shock after shock
and compel her to let go. I come to the weakling’s assistance and cut the wings of
her prey with my scissors. The maimed ones, still full of life, clamber up the trelliswork
and are forthwith grabbed by the Empusæ, who, in no way frightened by their protests,
crunch them up. The dish is to their taste and, moreover, plentiful, so much so that
there are always some despised remnants.
</p>
<p>The head only and the upper portion of the breast are devoured: the rest—the plump
abdomen, the best part of the thorax, the legs and lastly, of course, the wing-stumps—is
flung aside untouched. Does this mean that <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>the tenderest and most succulent morsels are chosen? No, for the belly is certainly
more juicy; and the Empusa refuses it, though she eats up her House-fly to the last
particle. It is a strategy of war. I am again in the presence of a neck-specialist
as expert as the Mantis herself in the art of swiftly slaying a victim that struggles
and, in struggling, spoils the meal.
</p>
<p>Once warned, I soon perceive that the game, be it Fly, Locust, Grasshopper or Butterfly,
is invariably struck in the neck, from behind. The first bite is aimed at the point
containing the cervical ganglia and produces sudden death or immobility. Complete
inertia will leave the consumer in peace, the essential condition of every satisfactory
repast.
</p>
<p>The Devilkin, therefore, frail though she be, possesses the secret of immediately
destroying the resistance of her prey. She bites at the back of the neck first, in
order to give the finishing stroke. She goes on nibbling around the original attacking-point.
In this way, the Butterfly’s head and the upper part of the breast are disposed of.
But, by that time, the huntress is surfeited: she wants so little! The rest lies on
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>ground, disdained, not for lack of flavour, but because there is too much of it. A
Cabbage Butterfly far exceeds the capacity of the Empusa’s stomach. The Ants will
benefit by what is left.
</p>
<p>There is one other matter to be mentioned, before observing the metamorphosis. The
position adopted by the young Empusæ in the wire-gauze cage is invariably the same
from start to finish. Gripping the trelliswork by the claws of its four hind-legs,
the insect occupies the top of the dome and hangs motionless, back downwards, with
the whole of its body supported by the four suspension-points. If it wishes to move,
the front harpoons open, stretch out, grasp a mesh and draw it to them. When the short
walk is over, the lethal arms are brought back against the chest. One may say that
it is nearly always the four hind-shanks which alone support the suspended insect.
</p>
<p>And this reversed position, which seems to us so trying, lasts for no short while:
it is prolonged, in my cages, for ten months without a break. The Fly on the ceiling,
it is true, occupies the same attitude; but she has her moments of rest: she flies,
she walks in a normal posture, she spreads herself flat <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>in the sun. Besides, her acrobatic feats do not cover a long period. The Empusa, on
the other hand, maintains her curious equilibrium for ten months on end, without a
break. Hanging from the trelliswork, back downwards, she hunts, eats, digests, dozes,
casts her skin, undergoes her transformation, mates, lays her eggs and dies. She clambered
up there when she was still quite young; she falls down, full of days, a corpse.
</p>
<p>Things do not happen exactly like this under natural conditions. The insect stands
on the bushes back upwards; it keeps its balance in the regular attitude and turns
over only in circumstances that occur at long intervals. The protracted suspension
of my captives is all the more remarkable inasmuch as it is not at all an innate habit
of their race.
</p>
<p>It reminds one of the Bats, who hang, head downwards, by their hind-legs from the
roof of their caves. A special formation of the toes enables birds to sleep on one
leg, which automatically and without fatigue clutches the swaying bough. The Empusa
shows me nothing akin to their contrivance. The extremity of her walking-legs has
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>ordinary structure: a double claw at the tip, a double steelyard-hook; and that is
all.
</p>
<p>I could wish that anatomy would show me the working of the muscles and nerves in those
tarsi, in those legs more slender than threads, the action of the tendons that control
the claws and keep them gripped for ten months, unwearied in waking and sleeping.
If some dexterous scalpel should ever investigate this problem, I can recommend another,
even more singular than that of the Empusa, the Bat and the bird. I refer to the attitude
of certain Wasps and Bees during the night’s rest.
</p>
<p>An Ammophila with red fore-legs (<i lang="la">A. holosericea</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2346src" href="#xd31e2346">2</a> is plentiful in my enclosure towards the end of August and selects a certain lavender-border
for her dormitory. At dusk, especially after a stifling day, when a storm is brewing,
I am sure to find the strange sleeper settled there. Never was more eccentric attitude
adopted for a night’s rest! The mandibles bite right into the lavender-stem. Its square
shape supplies a firmer hold than a round stalk would do. With this one and only prop,
the animal’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>body juts out stiffly, at full length, with legs folded. It forms a right angle with
the supporting axis, so much so that the whole weight of the insect, which has turned
itself into the arm of a lever, rests upon the mandibles.
</p>
<p>The Ammophila sleeps extended in space by virtue of its mighty jaws. It takes an animal
to think of a thing like that, which upsets all our preconceived ideas of repose.
Should the threatening storm burst, should the stalk sway in the wind, the sleeper
is not troubled by her swinging hammock; at most, she presses her fore-legs for a
moment against the tossed mast. As soon as equilibrium is restored, the favourite
posture, that of the horizontal lever, is resumed. Perhaps the mandibles, like the
bird’s toes, possess the faculty of gripping tighter in proportion to the rocking
of the wind.
</p>
<p>The Ammophila is not the only one to sleep in this singular position, which is copied
by many others—Anthidia,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2357src" href="#xd31e2357">3</a> Odyneri,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2363src" href="#xd31e2363">4</a> Euceræ<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2367src" href="#xd31e2367">5</a>—and mainly by the males. All <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>grip a stalk with their mandibles and sleep with their bodies outstretched and their
legs folded back. Some, the stouter species, allow themselves to rest the tip of their
arched abdomen against the pole.
</p>
<p>This visit to the dormitory of certain Wasps and Bees does not explain the problem
of the Empusa; it sets up another one, no less difficult. It shows us how deficient
we are in insight, when it comes to differentiating between fatigue and rest in the
cogs of the animal machine. The Ammophila, with the static paradox afforded by her
mandibles; the Empusa, with her claws unwearied by ten months’ hanging, leave the
physiologist perplexed and make him wonder what really constitutes rest. In absolute
fact, there is no rest, apart from that which puts an end to life. The struggle never
ceases; some muscle is always toiling, some nerve straining. Sleep, which resembles
a return to the peace of non-existence, is, like waking, an effort, here of the leg,
of the curled tail; there of the claw, of the jaws.
</p>
<p>The transformation is effected about the middle of May and the adult Empusa makes
her appearance. She is even more remarkable in figure and attire than the Praying
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>Mantis. Of her youthful eccentricities, she retains the pointed mitre, the saw-like
arm-guards, the long bust, the knee-pieces, the three rows of scales on the lower
surface of the belly; but the abdomen is now no longer twisted into a crook and the
animal is comelier to look upon. Large pale-green wings, pink at the shoulder and
swift in flight in both sexes, cover the belly, which is striped white and green underneath.
The male, the dandy sex, adorns himself with plumed antennæ, like those of certain
Moths, the Bombyx tribe. In respect of size, he is almost the equal of his mate.
</p>
<p>Save for a few slight structural details, the Empusa is the Praying Mantis. The peasant
confuses them. When, in spring, he meets the mitred insect, he thinks he sees the
common <i lang="fr">Prègo-Diéu</i>, who is a daughter of the autumn. Similar forms would seem to indicate similarity
of habits. In fact, led away by the extraordinary armour, we should be tempted to
attribute to the Empusa a mode of life even more atrocious than that of the Mantis.
I myself thought so at first; and any one, relying upon false analogies, would think
the same. It is a fresh error: for all her warlike aspect, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>Empusa is a peaceful creature that hardly repays the trouble of rearing.
</p>
<p>Installed under the gauze bell, whether in assemblies of half-a-dozen or in separate
couples, she at no time loses her placidity. Like the larva, she is very abstemious
and contents herself with a Fly or two as her daily ration.
</p>
<p>Big eaters are naturally quarrelsome. The Mantis, bloated with Locusts, soon becomes
irritated and shows fight. The Empusa, with her frugal meals, does not indulge in
hostile demonstrations. There is no strife among neighbours nor any of those sudden
unfurlings of the wings so dear to the Mantis when she assumes the spectral attitude
and puffs like a startled Adder; never the least inclination for those cannibal banquets
whereat the sister who has been worsted in the fight is devoured. Such atrocities
are here unknown.
</p>
<p>Unknown also are tragic nuptials. The male is enterprising and assiduous and is subjected
to a long trial before succeeding. For days and days, he worries his mate, who ends
by yielding. Due decorum is preserved after the wedding. The feathered groom retires,
respected by his bride, and does his little bit <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>of hunting, without danger of being apprehended and gobbled up.
</p>
<p>The two sexes live together in peace and mutual indifference until the middle of July.
Then the male, grown old and decrepit, takes counsel with himself, hunts no more,
becomes shaky in his walk, creeps down from the lofty heights of the trellised dome
and at last collapses on the ground. His end comes by a natural death. And remember
that the other, the male of the Praying Mantis, ends in the stomach of his gluttonous
spouse.
</p>
<p>The laying follows close upon the disappearance of the males. The Empusa, when about
to build her nest, has not the round belly of the Praying Mantis, rendered heavy and
inactive by her fertility. Her slender figure, still capable of flight, announces
a scanty progeny. Her nest, fixed upon a straw, a twig, a chip of stone, is quite
as small a structure as that of the dwarf Mantis (<i lang="la">Ameles decolor</i>) and measures two-fifths of an inch, at most, in length. The general shape is that
of a trapezoid, of which the shorter sides are, respectively, sloping and slightly
convex. As a rule, the sloping side is surmounted by a thread-like appendage, similar
to the final spur of the nests of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>Mantis and the Ameles, but finer in appearance. This is the last drop of viscous matter,
dried and drawn out. Builders, when their work is finished, crown the edifice with
a green bough and coloured streamers. In much the same way, the Mantis tribe set up
a mast on the completed nest.
</p>
<p>A very thin grey-wash, formed of dried foam, covers the Empusa’s work, especially
on the upper surface. Under this delicate glaze, which is easily rubbed off, the fundamental
substance appears, homogeneous, horny, pale-red. Six or seven hardly-perceptible furrows
divide the sides into curved sections.
</p>
<p>After the hatching, a dozen round orifices open on the top of the building, in two
alternate rows. These are the exit-doors for the young larvæ. The slightly projecting
rim is continued from each aperture to the next in a sort of ribbon with a double
row of alternating loops. It is obvious that the windings of this ribbon are the result
of an oscillating movement of the ovipositor in labour. Those exit-holes, so regular
in shape and arrangement, completed by the lateral ribs of the nest, present the appearance
of two dainty mouth-organs placed in <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>juxtaposition. Each of them corresponds with a cell containing two eggs. The eggs
in all, therefore, amount to about a couple of dozen.
</p>
<p>I have not seen the hatching. I do not know whether, as in the Praying Mantis, it
is preceded by a transition-stage adapted to facilitate the delivery. It may easily
be that there is nothing of the kind, since everything is so well-prepared for the
exit. Above the cells is a very short exit-hall, free of any obstacle. It is closed
merely by a small quantity of frothy, crumbly matter, which will readily yield to
the mandibles of the new-born larvæ. With this wide passage leading to the outer air,
long legs and slender antennæ cease to be embarrassing appendages; and the tiny creature
might well have the free use of them from the moment of leaving the egg, without going
through the primary larval stage. Not having seen for myself, I merely mention the
probable course of things.
</p>
<p>One word more on comparative manners. The Mantis goes in for battle and cannibalism;
the Empusa is peaceable and respects her kind. To what cause are these profound moral
differences due, when the organic <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>structure is the same? Perhaps to the difference of diet. Frugality, in fact, softens
character, in animals as in men; gross feeding brutalizes it. The gormandizer gorged
with meat and strong drink, a fruitful source of savage outbursts, could not possess
the gentleness of the ascetic who dips his bread into a cup of milk. The Mantis is
that gormandizer, the Empusa that ascetic.
</p>
<p>Granted. But whence does the one derive her voracious appetite, the other her temperate
ways, when it would seem as though their almost identical structure ought to produce
an identity of needs? These insects tell us, in their fashion, what many have already
told us: that propensities and aptitudes do not depend exclusively upon anatomy; high
above the physical laws that govern matter rise other laws that govern instincts.

<h2 class="main">THE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: HIS HABITS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The White-faced Decticus (<i lang="la">D. albifrons</i>, <span class="sc">Fabr.</span>) stands at the head of the Grasshopper clan in my district, both as a singer and
as an insect of imposing presence. He has a grey costume, a pair of powerful mandibles
and a broad ivory face. Without being plentiful, he does not let himself be sought
in vain. In the height of summer we find him hopping in the long grass, especially
at the foot of the sunny rocks where the turpentine-tree takes root.
</p>
<p>At the end of July I start a Decticus-menagerie. As a vivarium I adopt a big wire-gauze
cover standing on a bed of sifted earth. The population numbers a dozen; and both
sexes are equally represented.
</p>
<p>The question of victuals perplexes me for some time. It seems as though the regulation
diet ought to be a vegetable one, to judge by the Locust, who consumes any <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>green thing. I therefore offer my captives the tastiest and tenderest garden-stuff
that my enclosure holds: leaves of lettuce, chicory and corn-salad. The Dectici scarcely
touch it with a contemptuous tooth. It is not the food for them.
</p>
<p>Perhaps something tough would suit their strong mandibles better. I try various Graminaceæ,
including the glaucous panic-grass, the <i>miauco</i> of the Provençal peasant, the <i lang="la">Setaria glauca</i> of the botanists, a weed that infests the fields after the harvest. The panic-grass
is accepted by the hungry ones, but it is not the leaves that they devour: they attack
only the ears, of which they crunch the still tender seeds with visible satisfaction.
The food is found, at least for the time being. We shall see later.
</p>
<p>In the morning, when the rays of the sun visit the cage placed in the window of my
study, I serve out the day’s ration, a sheaf of green spikes of common grass picked
outside my door. The Dectici come running up to the handful, gather round it and,
very peaceably, without quarrelling among themselves, dig with their mandibles between
the bristles of the spikes to extract and nibble the unripe seeds. Their costume makes
one <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>think of a flock of Guinea-fowl pecking the grain scattered by the farmer’s wife.
When the spikes are robbed of their tender seeds, the rest is scorned, however urgent
the claims of hunger may be.
</p>
<p>To break the monotony of the diet as much as is possible in these dog-days, when everything
is burnt up, I gather a thick-leaved, fleshy plant which is not too sensitive to the
summer heat. This is the common purslane, another invader of our garden-beds. The
new green stuff meets with a good reception; and once again the Dectici dig their
teeth not into the leaves and the juicy stalks, but only into the swollen capsules
of half-formed grains.
</p>
<p>This taste for tender seeds surprises me: <span class="trans" title="dēktikos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δηκτικός</span></span>, biting, fond of biting, the lexicon tells us. A name that expresses nothing, a mere
identification-number, is able to satisfy the nomenclator; in my opinion, if the name
possesses a characteristic meaning and at the same time sounds well, it is all the
better for it. Such is the case here. The Decticus is eminently an insect given to
biting. Mind your finger if the sturdy Grasshopper gets hold of it: he will rip it
till the blood comes.
</p>
<p>And can this powerful jaw, of which I <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>have to beware when I handle the creature, possess no other function than to chew
soft grains? Can a mill like this have only to grind little unripe seeds? Something
has escaped me. So well-armed with mandibular pincers, so well-endowed with masticatory
muscles that swell out his cheeks, the Decticus must cut up some leathery prey.
</p>
<p>This time I find the real diet, the fundamental if not the exclusive one. Some good-sized
Locusts are let into the cage. I put in it the species mentioned in a note below,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2459src" href="#xd31e2459">1</a> now one, now the other, as they happen to get caught in my net. A few Grasshoppers<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2500src" href="#xd31e2500">2</a> are also accepted, but not so readily. There is every reason to think that, if I
had had the luck to capture them, the entire Locust and Grasshopper family would have
met the same fate, provided that they were not too insignificant in size.
</p>
<p>Any fresh meat tasting of Locust or Grasshopper suits my ogres. The most frequent
victim is the Blue-winged Locust. <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>There is a deplorably large consumption of this species in the cage. This is how things
happen: as soon as the game is introduced, an uproar ensues in the mess-room, especially
if the Dectici have been fasting for some time. They stamp about and, hampered by
their long shanks, dart forward clumsily; the Locusts make desperate bounds, rush
to the top of the cage and there hang on, out of the reach of the Grasshopper, who
is too stout to climb so high. Some are seized at once, as soon as they enter. The
others, who have taken refuge up in the dome, are only postponing for a little while
the fate that awaits them. Their turn will come; and that soon. Either because they
are tired or because they are tempted by the green stuff below, they will come down;
and the Dectici will be after them immediately.
</p>
<p>Speared by the hunter’s fore-legs, the game is first wounded in the neck. It is always
there, behind the head, that the Locust’s shell cracks first of all; it is always
there that the Decticus probes persistently before releasing his hold and taking his
subsequent meals off whatever joint he chooses.
</p>
<p>It is a very judicious bite. The Locust is hard to kill. Even when beheaded, he goes
<span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>on hopping. I have seen some who, though half-eaten, kick out desperately and succeed,
with a supreme effort, in releasing themselves and jumping away. In the brushwood,
that would be so much game lost.
</p>
<p>The Decticus seems to know all about it. To overcome his prey, so prompt to escape
by means of its two powerful levers, and to render it helpless as quickly as possible,
he first munches and extirpates the cervical ganglia, the main seat of innervation.
Is this an accident, in which the assassin’s choice plays no part? No, for I see the
murder performed invariably in the same way when the prey is in possession of its
full strength; and again no, because, when the Locust is offered in the form of a
fresh corpse, or when he is weak, dying, incapable of defence, the attack is made
anywhere, at the first spot that presents itself to the assailant’s jaws. In such
cases the Decticus begins either with a haunch, the favourite morsel, or with the
belly, back or chest. The preliminary bite in the neck is reserved for difficult occasions.
</p>
<p>This Grasshopper, therefore, despite his dull intellect, possesses the art of killing
scientifically of which we have seen so many <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>instances elsewhere;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2537src" href="#xd31e2537">3</a> but with him it is a rude art, falling within the knacker’s rather than the anatomist’s
domain.
</p>
<p>Two or three Blue-winged Locusts are none too many for a Decticus’ daily ration. It
all goes down, save the wings and wing-cases, which are disdained as too tough. In
addition, there is a snack of tender millet-grains stolen every now and again to make
a change from the banquet of game. They are big eaters, are my boarders; they surprise
me with their gormandizing and even more with their easy change from an animal to
a vegetable diet.
</p>
<p>With their accommodating and anything but particular stomachs, they could render some
slight service to agriculture, if there were more of them. They destroy the Locusts,
many of whom, even in our fields, are of ill fame; and they nibble, amid the unripe
corn, the seeds of a number of plants which are obnoxious to the husbandman.
</p>
<p>But the Decticus’ claim to the honours of the vivarium rests upon something much better
than his feeble assistance in preserving the fruits of the earth: in his song, his
nuptials <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>and his habits we have a memorial of the remotest times.
</p>
<p>How did the insect’s ancestors live, in the palæozoic age? They had their crude and
uncouth side, banished from the better-proportioned fauna of to-day; we catch a vague
glimpse of habits now almost out of use. It is unfortunate for our curiosity that
the fossil remains are silent on this magnificent subject.
</p>
<p>Luckily we have one resource left, that of consulting the successors of the prehistoric
insects. There is reason to believe that the Locustids<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2554src" href="#xd31e2554">4</a> of our own period have retained an echo of the ancient customs and can tell us something
of the manners of olden time. Let us begin by questioning the Decticus.
</p>
<p>In the vivarium the sated herd are lying on their bellies in the sun and blissfully
digesting their food, giving no other sign of life than a gentle swaying of the antennæ.
It is the hour of the after-dinner nap, the hour of enervating heat. From time to
time a male gets up, strolls solemnly about, raises his wing-cases slightly and utters
an occasional <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span><i>tick-tick</i>. Then he becomes more animated, hurries the pace of his tune and ends by grinding
out the finest piece in his repertoire.
</p>
<p>Is he celebrating his wedding? Is his song an epithalamium? I will make no such statement,
for his success is poor if he is really making an appeal to his fair neighbours. Not
one of his group of hearers gives a sign of attention. Not a female stirs, not one
moves from her comfortable place in the sun. Sometimes the solo becomes a concerted
piece sung by two or three in chorus. The multiple invitation succeeds no better.
True, their impassive ivory faces give no indication of their real feelings. If the
suitors’ ditty indeed exercises any sort of seduction, no outward sign betrays the
fact.
</p>
<p>According to all appearances, the clicking is addressed to heedless ears. It rises
in a passionate crescendo until it becomes a continuous rattle. It ceases when the
sun vanishes behind a cloud and starts afresh when the sun shows itself again; but
it leaves the ladies indifferent.
</p>
<p>She who was lying with her shanks outstretched on the blazing sand does not change
her position; her antennary threads <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>give not a quiver more and not a quiver less; she who was gnawing the remains of a
Locust does not let go the morsel, does not lose a mouthful. To look at those heartless
ones, you would really say that the singer was making a noise for the mere pleasure
of feeling himself alive.
</p>
<p>It is a very different matter when, towards the end of August, I witness the start
of the wedding. The couple finds itself standing face to face quite casually, without
any lyrical prelude whatever. Motionless, as though turned to stone, with their foreheads
almost touching, the two exchange caresses with their long antennæ, fine as hairs.
The male seems somewhat preoccupied. He washes his tarsi; with the tips of his mandibles
he tickles the soles of his feet. From time to time he gives a stroke of the bow:
<i>tick</i>; no more.
</p>
<p>Yet one would think that this was the very moment at which to make the most of his
strong points. Why not declare his flame in a fond couplet, instead of standing there,
scratching his feet? Not a bit of it. He remains silent in front of the coveted bride,
herself impassive.
</p>
<p>The interview, a mere exchange of greetings <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>between friends of different sexes, does not last long. What do they say to each other,
forehead to forehead? Not much, apparently, for soon they separate with nothing further;
and each goes his way where he pleases.
</p>
<p>Next day, the same two meet again. This time, the song, though still very brief, is
in a louder key than on the day before, while being still very far from the burst
of sound to which the Decticus will give utterance long before the pairing. For the
rest, it is a repetition of what I saw yesterday: mutual caresses with the antennæ,
which limply pat the well-rounded sides.
</p>
<p>The male does not seem greatly enraptured. He again nibbles his foot and seems to
be reflecting. Alluring though the enterprise may be, it is perhaps not unattended
with danger. Can there be a nuptial tragedy here, similar to that which the Praying
Mantis has shown us? Can the business be exceptionally grave? Have patience and you
shall see. For the moment, nothing more happens.
</p>
<p>A few days later, a little light is thrown upon the subject. The male is underneath,
lying flat on the sand and towered over by <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>his powerful spouse, who, with her sabre exposed, standing high on her hind-legs,
overwhelms him with her embrace. No, indeed: in this posture the poor Decticus has
nothing of the victor about him! The other, brutally, without respecting the musical-box,
is forcing open his wing-cases and nibbling his flesh just where the belly begins.
</p>
<p>Which of the two takes the initiative here? Have not the parts been reversed? She
who is usually provoked is now the provoker, employing rude caresses capable of carrying
off the morsel touched. She has not yielded to him; she has thrust herself upon him,
disturbingly, imperiously. He, lying flat on the ground, quivers and starts, seems
trying to resist. What outrageous thing is about to happen? I shall not know to-day.
The floored male releases himself and runs away.
</p>
<p>But this time, at last, we have it. Master Decticus is on the ground, tumbled over
on his back. Hoisted to the full height of her shanks, the other, holding her sabre
almost perpendicular, covers her prostrate mate from a distance. The two ventral extremities
curve into a hook, seek each other, meet; and soon from the male’s convulsive loins
there <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>is seen to issue, in painful labour, something monstrous and unheard-of, as though
the creature were expelling its entrails in a lump.
</p>
<p>It is an opalescent bag, similar in size and colour to a mistletoe-berry, a bag with
four pockets marked off by faint grooves, two larger ones above and two smaller ones
below. In certain cases the number of cells increases and the whole assumes the appearance
of a packet of eggs such as <i lang="la">Helix aspersa</i>, the Common Snail, lays in the ground.
</p>
<p>The strange concern remains hanging from the lower end of the sabre of the future
mother, who solemnly retires with the extraordinary wallet, the spermatophore, as
the physiologists call it, the source of life for the ovules, in other words the cruet
which will now in due course transmit to the proper place the necessary complement
for the evolution of the germs.
</p>
<p>A capsule of this kind is a rare, an infinitely rare thing in the world of to-day.
So far as I know, the Cephalopods<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2599src" href="#xd31e2599">5</a> and the Scolopendras<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2603src" href="#xd31e2603">6</a> are, in our time, the only <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>other animals that make use of the queer apparatus. Now Octopuses and Millepedes date
back to the earliest ages. The Decticus, another representative of the old world,
seems to tell us that what is a curious exception now might well have been a more
or less general rule originally, all the more so as we shall come upon similar incidents
in the case of the other Grasshoppers.
</p>
<p>When the male has recovered from his shock, he shakes the dust off himself and once
more begins his merry click-clack. For the present let us leave him to his joys and
follow the mother that is to be, pacing along solemnly with her burden, which is fastened
with a plug of jelly as transparent as glass.
</p>
<p>At intervals she draws herself up on her shanks, curls into a ring and seizes her
opalescent load in her mandibles, nibbling it calmly and squeezing it, but without
tearing the wrapper or shedding any of the contents. Each time, she removes from the
surface a particle which she chews and then chews again slowly, ending by swallowing
it.
</p>
<p>This process is continued for twenty minutes or so. Then the capsule, now drained,
is torn off in a single piece, all but the jelly plug at the end. The huge, sticky
<span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>mass is not let go for a moment, but is munched, ground and kneaded by the insect’s
mandibles and at last gulped down whole.
</p>
<p>At first I looked upon the horrible banquet as no more than an individual aberration,
an accident: the Decticus’ behaviour was so extraordinary; no other instance of it
was known to me. But I have had to yield to the evidence of the facts. Four times
in succession I surprised my captives dragging their wallet and four times I saw them
soon tear it, work at it solemnly with their mandibles for hours on end and finally
gulp it down. It is therefore the rule: when its contents have reached their destination,
the fertilizing capsule, possibly a powerful stimulant, an unparalleled dainty, is
chewed, enjoyed and swallowed.
</p>
<p>If this, as we are entitled to believe, is a relic of ancient manners, we must admit
that the insect of old had singular customs. Réaumur tells us of the startling operations
of the Dragon-flies when pairing. This again is a nuptial eccentricity of primeval
times.
</p>
<p>When the Decticus has finished her strange feast, the end of the apparatus still remains
in its place, the end whose most visible <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>part consists of two crystalline nipples the size of pepper-corns. To rid itself of
this plug, the insect assumes a curious attitude. The ovipositor is driven half-way
into the earth, perpendicularly. That will be the prop. The long hind-legs straighten
out, raise the creature as high as possible and form a tripod with the sabre.
</p>
<p>Then the insect again curves itself into a complete circle and, with its mandibles,
crumbles to atoms the end of the apparatus, consisting of a plug of clearest jelly.
All these remnants are scrupulously swallowed. Not a scrap must be lost. Lastly, the
ovipositor is washed, wiped, smoothed with the tips of the palpi. Everything is put
in order again; nothing remains of the cumbrous load. The normal pose is resumed and
the Decticus goes back to pilfering the ears of millet.
</p>
<p>To return to the male. Limp and exhausted, as though shattered by his exploit, he
remains where he is, all shrivelled and shrunk. He is so motionless that I believe
him dead. Not a bit of it! The gallant fellow recovers his spirits, picks himself
up, polishes himself and goes off. A quarter of an hour later, when he has taken a
few mouthfuls, <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>behold him stridulating once more. The tune is certainly lacking in spirit. It is
far from being as brilliant or prolonged as it was before the wedding; but, after
all, the poor old crock is doing his best.
</p>
<p>Can he have any further amorous pretensions? It is hardly likely. Affairs of that
kind, calling for ruinous expenditure, are not to be repeated: it would be too much
for the works of the organism. Nevertheless, next day and every day after, when a
diet of Locusts has duly renewed his strength, the Decticus scrapes his bow as noisily
as ever. He might be a novice, instead of a glutted veteran. His persistence surprises
me.
</p>
<p>If he be really singing to attract the attention of his fair neighbours, what would
he do with a second wife, he who has just extracted from his paunch a monstrous wallet
in which all life’s savings were accumulated? He is thoroughly used up. No, once more,
in the big Grasshopper these things are too costly to be done all over again. To-day’s
song, despite its gladness, is certainly no epithalamium.
</p>
<p>And, if you watch him closely, you will see that the singer no longer responds to
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>teasing of the passers’ antennæ. The ditties become fainter from day to day and occur
less frequently. In a fortnight the insect is dumb. The dulcimer no longer sounds,
for lack of vigour in the player.
</p>
<p>At last the decrepit Decticus, who now scarcely touches food, seeks a peaceful retreat,
sinks to the ground exhausted, stretches out his shanks in a last throe and dies.
As it happens, the widow passes that way, sees the deceased and, breathing eternal
remembrance, gnaws off one of his thighs.
</p>
<p>The Green Grasshopper behaves similarly. A couple isolated in a cage are subjected
to a special watch. I am present at the end of the pairing, when the future mother
is carrying, fixed to the point of her sword, the pretty raspberry which will occupy
our attention later.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2636src" href="#xd31e2636">7</a> Debilitated by recent happenings, the male at this moment is mute. Next day, his
strength returns; and you hear him singing as ardently as ever. He stridulates while
the mother is scattering her eggs over the ground; he goes on making a noise long
after the laying is done and when nothing more is wanted to perpetuate the race.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is quite clear that this persistent singing has not an amorous appeal for its object:
by this time, all of that is over, quite over. Lastly, one day or another, life fails
and the instrument is dumb. The eager singer is no more. The survivor gives him a
funeral copied from that of the Decticus: she devours the best bits of him. She loved
him so much that she had to eat him up.
</p>
<p>These cannibal habits recur in most of the Grasshopper tribe, without however equalling
the atrocities of the Praying Mantis, who treats her lovers as dead game while they
are still full of life. The Decticus mother, the Green Grasshopper and the rest at
least wait until the poor wretches are dead.
</p>
<p>I will except the Ephippiger, who is so meek in appearance. In my cage, when laying-time
is at hand, she has no scruples about taking a bite at her companions, without possessing
the excuse of hunger. Most of the males end in this lamentable fashion, half-devoured.
The mutilated victim protests; he would rather, he could indeed go on living. Having
no other means of defence, he produces with his bow a few grating sounds which this
time decidedly are not a nuptial song. Dying with a great hole in his belly, he utters
his <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>plaint in a like manner as though he were rejoicing in the sun. His instrument strikes
the same note whether it express sorrow or gladness.

<h2 class="main">THE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: THE LAYING AND THE HATCHING OF THE EGGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The White-faced Decticus is an African insect that in France hardly ventures beyond
the borders of Provence and Languedoc. She wants the sun that ripens the olives. Can
it be that a high temperature acts as a stimulus to her matrimonial eccentricities,
or are we to look upon these as family customs, independent of climate? Do things
happen under frosty skies just as they do under a burning sun?
</p>
<p>I go for my information to another Decticus, the Alpine Analota (<i lang="la">A. alpina</i>, <span class="sc">Yersin</span>), who inhabits the high ridges of Mont Ventoux,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2663src" href="#xd31e2663">1</a> which are covered with snow for half the year. Many a time, during my old botanical
expeditions, I had noticed the <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>portly insect hopping among the stones from one bit of turf to the next. This time,
I do not go in search of it: it reaches me by post. Following my indications, an obliging
forester<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2671src" href="#xd31e2671">2</a> climbs up there twice in the first fortnight of August and brings me back the wherewithal
to fill a cage comfortably.
</p>
<p>In shape and colouring it is a curious specimen of the Grasshopper family. Satin-white
underneath, it has the upper part sometimes olive-black, sometimes bright-green or
pale-brown. The organs of flight are reduced to mere vestiges. The female has as wing-cases
two short white scales, some distance apart; the male shelters under the edge of his
corselet two little concave plates, also white, but laid one on top of the other,
the left on the right.
</p>
<p>These two tiny cupolas, with bow and sounding-board, rather suggest, on a smaller
scale, the musical instrument of the Ephippiger, whom the mountain insect resembles
to some extent in general appearance.
</p>
<p>I do not know what sort of tune cymbals so small as these can produce. I do not remember
ever hearing them in their native <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>haunts; and three months’ home breeding gives me no further information in this respect.
Though they lead a joyous life, my captives are always dumb.
</p>
<p>The exiles do not seem greatly to regret their cold peaks, among the orange poppies
and saxifrages of arctic climes. What used they to browse upon up there? The Alpine
meadow-grass, Mont-Cenis violets, Allioni’s bell-flower? I do not know. In the absence
of Alpine grasses, I give them the common endive from my garden. They accept it without
hesitation.
</p>
<p>They also accept such Locusts as can offer only a feeble resistance; and the diet
alternates between animal and vegetable fare. They even practise cannibalism. If one
of my Alpine visitors limps and drags a leg, the others eat him up. So far I have
seen nothing striking: these are the usual Grasshopper manners.
</p>
<p>The interesting sight is the pairing, which occurs suddenly, without any prelude.
The meeting takes place sometimes on the ground, sometimes on the wirework of the
cage. In the latter case, the sword-bearer, firmly hooked to the trellis, supports
the whole weight of the couple. The other is back <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>downwards, his head pointing to his mate’s tail. With his long, fleshy-shanked hind-legs,
he gets a grip of her sides; with his four front legs, often also with his mandibles,
he grasps and squeezes the sabre, which projects slantwise. Thus hanging to this sort
of greased pole, he operates in space.
</p>
<p>When the meeting takes place on the ground, the couple occupy the same position, only
the male is lying on his back in the sand. In both cases the result is an opal grain
which, in the visible part of it, resembles in shape and size the swollen end of a
grape-pip.
</p>
<p>As soon as this object is in position, the male decamps at full speed. Can he be in
danger? Possibly, to judge from what I have seen. I admit that I have seen it only
once.
</p>
<p>The bride in this case was grappling with two rivals. One of them, hanging to the
sabre, was at work in due form behind; the other, in front, tightly clawed and with
his belly ripped open, was waving his limbs in vain protest against the harpy crunching
him impassively in small mouthfuls. I had before my eyes, under even more atrocious
conditions, the horrors which the Praying Mantis had shown me in the old days: unbridled
<span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>rut; carnage and voluptuousness in one; a reminiscence perhaps of ancient savagery.
</p>
<p>As a rule, the male, a dwarf by comparison with the female, hastens to run away as
soon as his task is consummated. The deserted one makes no movement. Then, after waiting
twenty minutes or so, she curves herself into a ring and proceeds to enjoy the final
banquet. She pulls the sticky raisin-pip into shreds which are chewed with grave appreciation
and then gulped down. It takes her more than an hour to swallow the thing. When not
a crumb remains, she descends from the wire gauze and mingles with the herd. Her eggs
will be laid in a day or two.
</p>
<p>The proof is established. The matrimonial habits of the White-faced Decticus are not
an exception due to the heat of the climate: the Grasshopper from the cold peaks shares
them and surpasses them.
</p>
<p>We will return to the big Decticus with the ivory face. The laying follows close upon
the strange events which we have described. It is done piecemeal, as the ovaries ripen.
Firmly planted on her six legs, the mother bends her abdomen into a semicircle and
drives her sabre perpendicularly into the <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>soil, which, consisting in my cages of sifted earth, presents no serious resistance.
The ovipositor therefore descends without hesitation and enters up to the hilt, that
is to say, to a depth of about an inch.
</p>
<p>For nearly fifteen minutes, absolute immobility. This is the time when the eggs are
being laid. At last the sabre comes up a little way and the abdomen swings briskly
from side to side, communicating an alternate transversal movement to the implement.
This tends to scrape out and widen the sunken hole; it also has the effect of releasing
from the walls earthy materials which fill up the bottom of the cavity. Thereupon
the ovipositor, which is half in and half out, rams down this dust. It comes up a
short distance and then dips repeatedly, with a sudden, jerky movement. We should
work in the same way with a stick to ram down the earth in a perpendicular hole. Thus
alternating the transversal swing of the sabre with the blows of the rammer, the mother
covers up the well pretty quickly.
</p>
<p>The external traces of the work have still to be done away with. The insect’s legs,
which I expected to see brought into play, remain inactive and keep the position <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>adopted for laying the eggs. The sabre alone scratches, sweeps and smooths the ground
with its point, very clumsily, it must be admitted.
</p>
<p>Now all is in order. The abdomen and the ovipositor are restored to their normal positions.
The mother allows herself a moment’s rest and goes to take a turn in the neighbourhood.
Soon she comes back to the site where she has already laid her eggs and, very near
the original spot, which she recognizes clearly, she drives in her tool afresh. The
same proceedings as before are repeated.
</p>
<p>Follow another rest, another exploration of the vicinity, another return to the place
already sown. For the third time the pointed stake descends, only a very slight distance
away from the previous hole. During the brief hour that I am watching her, I see her
resume her laying five times, after breaking off to take a little stroll in the neighbourhood;
and the points selected are always very close together.
</p>
<p>On the following days, at varying intervals, the sowing is renewed for a certain number
of times which I am not able to state exactly. In the case of each of these partial
<span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>layings, the site changes, now here, now there, as this or that spot is deemed the
more propitious.
</p>
<p>When everything is finished, I examine the little pits in which the Decticus placed
her eggs. There are no packets in a foamy sheath, such as the Locust supplies; no
cells either. The eggs lie singly, without any protection. I gather three score as
the total product of one mother. They are of a pale lilac-grey and are drawn out shuttlewise,
in a narrow ellipsoid five or six millimetres long.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2713src" href="#xd31e2713">3</a>
</p>
<p>The same isolation marks those of the Grey Decticus, which are black; those of the
Vine Ephippiger, which are ashen-grey; and those of the Alpine Analota, which are
pale-lilac. The eggs of the Green Grasshopper, which are a very dark olive-brown and,
like those of the White-faced Decticus, about sixty in number, are sometimes arranged
singly and sometimes stuck together in little clusters.
</p>
<p>These different examples show us that the Grasshoppers plant with a dibble. Instead
of packing their seeds in little casks of hardened foam, like the Locusts, they put
<span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>them into the earth one by one or in very small clusters.
</p>
<p>The hatching is worth examination; I will explain why presently. I therefore gather
plenty of eggs of the big Decticus at the end of August and place them in a small
glass jar with a layer of sand. Without undergoing any apparent modification, they
spend eight months here under cover, sheltered from the frosts, the showers and the
overpowering heat of the sun that would await them under natural conditions.
</p>
<p>When June comes, I often meet young Dectici in the fields. Some are already half their
adult size, which is evidence of an early appearance dating back to the first fine
days of the year. Nevertheless my jar shows no signs of any imminent hatching. I find
the eggs just as I gathered them nine months ago, neither wrinkled nor tarnished,
wearing, on the contrary, a most healthy look. What causes this indefinitely prolonged
delay?
</p>
<p>A suspicion occurs to me. The eggs of the Grasshopper tribe are planted in the earth
like seeds. They are there exposed, without any kind of protection, to the watery
influence of the snow and the rain. Those <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>in my jar have spent two-thirds of the year in a state of comparative dryness. Perhaps,
in order to hatch, they lack what grain absolutely needs in order to sprout. Animal
seeds as they are, they may yet require under earth the moisture necessary to vegetable
seeds. Let us try.
</p>
<p>I place at the bottom of some glass tubes, to enable me to make certain observations
which I have in mind, a pinch of backward eggs taken from my collection; and on the
top I heap lightly a layer of very fine, damp sand. The receptacle is closed with
a plug of wet cotton, which will maintain a constant moisture in the interior. The
column of sand measures about an inch, which is very much the depth at which the ovipositor
places the eggs. Any one seeing my preparations and unacquainted with their object
would hardly suspect them of being incubators; he would be more likely to think them
the apparatus of a botanist who was experimenting with seeds.
</p>
<p>My anticipation was correct. Favoured by the high temperature of the summer solstice,
the Grasshopper seed does not take long to sprout. The eggs swell; the front end of
each is spotted with two dark dots, <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>the rudiments of the eyes. It is quite evident that the bursting of the shell is near
at hand.
</p>
<p>I spend a fortnight in keeping a tedious watch at every hour of the day: I have to
surprise the young Decticus actually leaving the egg, if I want to solve a question
that has long been vexing my mind. The question is this: the Grasshopper’s egg is
buried at a varying depth, according to the length of the ovipositor or dibble. An
inch is about the most for the seeds of the best-equipped insects in our parts. Now
the newborn Decticus, hopping awkwardly in the grass at the approach of summer, is,
like the adult, endowed with a pair of very long tentacles, vying with hairs for slenderness;
he carries behind him two extraordinary legs, two enormous hinged levers, a pair of
jumping-stilts that would be very inconvenient for ordinary walking. How does the
feeble little creature set to work, with this cumbrous luggage, to emerge from the
earth? By what artifice does it manage to clear a passage through the rough soil?
With its antennary plumes, which an atom of sand can break, with its immense shanks,
which the least effort is enough to <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>disjoint, the mite is obviously incapable of reaching the surface and freeing itself.
</p>
<p>The miner going underground puts on a protective dress. The little Grasshopper also,
making a hole in the earth in the opposite direction, must don an overall for emerging
from the earth; he must possess a simpler, more compact transition-form, which enables
him to come out through the sand, a delivery-shape analogous to that which the Cicada
and the Praying Mantis use at the moment of issuing, one from his twig, the other
from the labyrinth of his nest.
</p>
<p>Reality and logic here agree. The Decticus, in point of fact, does not leave the egg
in the form in which I see him, the day after his birth, hopping on the lawn; he possesses
a temporary structure better-suited to the difficulties of the emergence. Coloured
a delicate flesh-white, the tiny creature is cased in a scabbard which keeps the six
legs flattened against the abdomen, stretching backwards, inert. In order to slip
more easily under the ground, he has his shanks tied up beside his body. The antennæ,
those other irksome appendages, are motionless, pressed against the parcel.
</p>
<p>The head is very much bent against the <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>chest. With its big, black ocular specks and its undecided and rather bloated mask,
it suggests a diver’s helmet. The neck opens wide at the back and, with a slow throbbing,
by turns swells and subsides. That is the motor. The new-born insect moves along with
the aid of its occipital hernia. When uninflated, the fore-part pushes back the damp
sand a little way and slips into it by digging a tiny pit; then, blown out, it becomes
a knob, which moulds itself and finds a support in the depression obtained. Then the
rear-end contracts; and this gives a step forward. Each thrust of the locomotive blister
means nearly a millimetre<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2744src" href="#xd31e2744">4</a> traversed.
</p>
<p>It is pitiful to see this budding flesh, scarcely tinged with pink, knocking with
its dropsical neck and ramming the rough soil. The animal glair, not yet quite hardened,
struggles painfully with stone; and its efforts are so well directed that, in the
space of a morning, a gallery opens, either straight or winding, an inch long and
as wide as an average straw. In this way the harassed insect reaches the surface.
</p>
<p>Half-caught in its exit-shaft, the disinterred one halts, waits for its strength to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>return and then for the last time swells its occipital hernia as far as it will go
and bursts the sheath that has protected it so far. The creature throws off its miner’s
overall.
</p>
<p>Here at last is the Decticus in his youthful shape, quite pale still, but darker the
next day and a regular blackamoor compared with the adult. As a prelude to the ivory
face of a riper age, he sports a narrow white stripe under his hinder thighs.
</p>
<p>Little Decticus, hatched before my eyes, life opens for you very harshly! Many of
your kindred must die of exhaustion before attaining their freedom. In my tubes I
see numbers who, stopped by a grain of sand, succumb half-way and become furred with
a sort of silky mildew. The mouldy part soon absorbs their poor little remains. When
performed without my assistance, the coming to the light of day must be attended with
even greater dangers. The usual soil is coarse and baked by the sun. Without a fall
of rain, how do they manage, these immured ones?
</p>
<p>More fortunate in my tubes with their sifted and wetted mould, here you are outside,
you little white-striped nigger; you bite at the lettuce-leaf which I have given <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>you; you leap about gaily in the cage where I have housed you. It would be easy to
rear you, I can see, but it would not give me much fresh information. Let us then
part company. I restore you to liberty. In return for what you have taught me, I bestow
upon you the grass and the Locusts in the garden.
</p>
<p>Thanks to you, I know that Grasshoppers, in order to leave the ground in which the
eggs are laid, possess a provisional shape, a primary larval stage, which keeps those
too cumbrous parts, the long legs and antennæ, swathed in a common sheath; I know
that this sort of mummy, fit only to lengthen and shorten itself a little, has for
an organ of locomotion a hernia in the neck, a throbbing blister, an original piece
of mechanism which I have never seen used elsewhere as an aid to progression.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2762src" href="#xd31e2762">5</a>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE WHITE-FACED DECTICUS: THE INSTRUMENT OF SOUND</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Art has three fields which it may cultivate in the realm of natural objects: form,
colour and sound. The sculptor uses form and imitates its perfection in so far as
the chisel is able to imitate life. The draughtsman, likewise a copyist, seeks in
black and white to give the illusion of relief on a flat surface. To the difficulties
of drawing the painter adds those of colour, which are no less great.
</p>
<p>An inexhaustible model sits to all three. Rich though the painter’s palette be, it
will always be inferior to that of reality. Nor will the sculptor’s chisel ever exhaust
the treasures of the plastic art in nature. Form and colour, beauty of outline and
play of light: these are all taught by the contemplation of actual things. They are
imitated, <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>they are combined according to our tastes, but they are not invented.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, our music has no prototype in the symphony of created things. Certainly
there is no lack of sounds, faint or loud, sweet and solemn. The wind roaring through
the storm-tossed woods, the waves curling and breaking on the beach, the thunder growling
in the echoing clouds stir us with their majestic notes; the breeze filtering through
the tiny foliage of the pine-trees, the Bees humming over the spring flowers charm
every ear endowed with any delicacy; but these are monotonous noises, with no connection.
Nature has superb sounds; she has no music.
</p>
<p>Howling, braying, grunting, neighing, bellowing, bleating, yelping: these exhaust
the phonetics of our near neighbours in organization. A musical score composed of
such elements would be called a hullabaloo. Man, forming a striking exception at the
top of the scale of these makers of raucous noises, took it into his head to sing.
An attribute which no other shares with him, the attribute of coordinated sounds whence
springs the incomparable gift of speech, led him on to scientific vocal exercises.
In the absence <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>of a model, it must have been a laborious apprenticeship.
</p>
<p>When our prehistoric ancestor, to celebrate his return from hunting the Mammoth, intoxicated
himself with sour tipple brewed from raspberries and sloes, what can have issued from
his hoarse larynx? An orthodox melody? Certainly not; hoarse shouts, rather, capable
of shaking the roof of his cave. The loudness of the cry constituted its merit. The
primitive song is found to this day when men’s throats are fired in taverns instead
of caverns.
</p>
<p>And this tenor, with his crude vocal efforts, was already an adept at guiding his
pointed flint to engrave on ivory the effigy of the monstrous animal which he had
captured; he knew how to embellish his idol’s cheeks with red chalk; he knew how to
paint his own face with coloured grease. There were plenty of models for form and
colour but none for rhythmic sounds.
</p>
<p>With progress came the musical instrument, as an adjunct to those first guttural attempts.
Men blew down tubes taken all in one piece from the sappy branches; they produced
sounds from the barley-stalks and made whistles out of reeds. The shell of a <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>Snail, held between two fingers of the closed fist, imitated the Partridge’s call;
a trumpet formed of a wide strip of bark rolled into a horn reproduced the bellowing
of the Bull; a few gut-strings stretched across the empty shell of a calabash grated
out the first notes of our stringed instruments; a Goat’s bladder, fixed on a solid
frame, was the original drum; two flat pebbles struck together at measured intervals
led the way for the click of the castagnettes. Such must have been the primitive musical
materials, materials still preserved by the child, which, with its simplicity in things
artistic, is so strongly reminiscent of the big child of yore.
</p>
<p>Classical antiquity knew no others, as witness the shepherds of Theocritus and Virgil.
</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Silvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena,</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">says Meliboeus to Tityrus.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2798src" href="#xd31e2798">1</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>What are we to make of this oat-straw, this frail shepherd’s pipe, as they used to
make us translate it in my young days? Did the poet write <i lang="la">avena tenui</i> by way of a rhetorical figure, or was he describing a reality? I vote for the reality,
having myself in the old days heard a concert of shepherd’s pipes.
</p>
<p>It was in Corsica, at Ajaccio. In gratitude for a handful of sugar-plums, some small
boys of the neighbourhood came one day and serenaded me. Quite unexpectedly, in gusts
of untutored harmony, strange sounds of rare sweetness reached my ears. I ran to the
window. There stood the orchestra, none taller than a jack-boot, gathered solemnly
in a ring, with the leader in the middle. Most of them had at their lips a green onion-stem,
distended spindlewise; others a stubble straw, a bit of reed not yet hardened by maturity.
</p>
<p>They blew into these, or rather they sang a <i lang="la">vocero</i>, to a grave measure, perhaps a relic of the Greeks. Certainly, it was not music as
we understand it; still less was it a meaningless noise; but it was a vague, undulating
melody, abounding in artless irregularities, a medley of pretty sounds in which <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>the sibilations of the straw threw into relief the bleating of the swollen stalks.
I stood amazed at the onion-stem symphony. Very much so must the shepherds of the
eclogue have gone to work, <i lang="la">avena tenui</i>; very much so must the bridal epithalamium have been sung in the Reindeer period.
</p>
<p>Yes, the simple melody of my Corsican youngsters, a real humming of Bees on the rosemaries,
has left a lasting trace in my memory. I can hear it now. It taught me the value of
the rustic pipes, once so constantly celebrated in a literature that is now old-fashioned.
How far removed are we from those simple joys! To charm the populace in these days
you need ophicleides, saxhorns, trombones, cornets, every imaginable sort of brass,
with big drums and little drums and, to beat time, a gun-shot. That’s what progress
does.
</p>
<p>Three-and-twenty centuries ago, Greece assembled at Delphi for the festivals of the
sun, Phœbus with the golden locks. Thrilled with religious emotion she listened to
the Hymn of Apollo, a melody of a few lines, barely supported here and there by a
scanty chord on the flute and cithara. Hailed as a masterpiece, the sacred song was
engraved <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>on marble tablets which the archæologists have recently exhumed.
</p>
<p>The venerable strains, the oldest in musical records, have been heard in my time in
the ancient theatre at Orange, a ruin in stone worthy of that ruin of sound. I was
not present at the performance, being kept away by my habit of running to the west
whenever there are fireworks in the east. One of my friends, a man gifted with a very
sensitive ear, went; and he said to me afterwards:
</p>
<p>“There were probably ten thousand people forming the audience in the enormous amphitheatre.
I very much doubt whether one of them understood that music of another age. As for
me, I felt as if I were listening to a blind man’s plaintive ditty and I looked round
involuntarily for the dog holding the cup.”
</p>
<p>The barbarian, to turn the Greek masterpiece into a stupid wail! Was it irreverence
on his part? No, but it was incapacity. His ear, trained in accordance with other
rules, was unable to take pleasure in artless sounds which had become strange and
even disagreeable owing to their great age. What my friend lacked, what we all lack
is the perception <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>of those primitive niceties which have been stifled by the centuries. To enjoy the
Hymn to Apollo, we should have to go back to the simplicity of soul which one day
made me think the buzzing of the onion-stalks delightful. And that we shall never
do.
</p>
<p>But, if our music need not draw its inspiration from the Delphic marbles, our statuary
and our architecture will always find models of incomparable perfection in the work
of the Greeks. The art of sounds, having no prototype imposed on it by natural facts,
is liable to change: with our fickle tastes, that which is perfect in music to-day
becomes vulgar and commonplace to-morrow. The art of forms, on the contrary, being
based on the immutable foundation of reality, always sees the beautiful where previous
centuries saw it.
</p>
<p>There is no musical type anywhere, not even in the song of the Nightingale, celebrated
by Buffon<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2848src" href="#xd31e2848">2</a> in grandiloquent terms. <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>I have no wish to shock anybody; but why should I not give my opinion? Buffon’s style
and the Nightingale’s song both leave me cold. The first has too much rhetoric about
it and not enough sincere emotion. The second, a magnificent jewel-case of ill-assorted
pearls of sound, makes so slight an appeal to the soul that a penny jug, filled with
water and furnished with a whistle, will enable the lips of a child to reproduce the
celebrated songster’s finest trills. A little earthenware machine, warbling at the
player’s will, rivals the Nightingale.
</p>
<p>Above the bird, that glorious production of a vibrating air-column, creatures roar
and bray and grunt, until we come to man, who alone speaks and really sings. Below
the bird, they croak or are silent. The bellows of the lungs have two efflorescences
separated by enormous empty spaces filled with formless sounds. Lower down still is
the insect, which is much earlier in date. This first-born of the dwellers on the
earth is also the first singer. Deprived of the breath which could set the vocal cords
vibrating, it invents the bow and friction, of which man is later to make such wonderful
use.
</p>
<p>Various Beetles produce a noise by sliding <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>one rugged surface over another. The Capricorn moves his corseleted segment over its
junction with the rest of the thorax; the Pine Cockchafer,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2863src" href="#xd31e2863">3</a> with his great fan-shaped antennæ, rubs his last dorsal segment with the edge of
his wing-cases; the Copris<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2869src" href="#xd31e2869">4</a> and many more know no other method. To tell the truth, these scrapers do not produce
a musical sound, but rather a creaking like that of a weathercock on its rusty pin,
a thin, sharp sound with no resonance in it.
</p>
<p>Among these inexperienced scrapers, I will select the Bolboceras (<i lang="la">B. gallicus</i>, <span class="sc">Muls.</span>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2883src" href="#xd31e2883">5</a> as deserving honourable mention. Round as a ball, sporting a horn on his forehead,
like the Spanish Copris, whose stercoral tastes he does not share, this pretty Beetle
loves the pine-woods in my neighbourhood and digs himself a burrow in the sand, leaving
it in the evening twilight with the gentle chirp of a well-fed nestling under its
mother’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>wing. Though habitually silent, he makes a noise at the least disturbance. A dozen
of him imprisoned in a box will provide you with a delightful symphony, very faint,
it is true: you have to hold the box close to your ear to hear it. Compared with him,
the Capricorn, Copris, Pine Cockchafer and the rest are rustic fiddlers. In their
case, after all, it is not singing, but rather an expression of fear, I might almost
say, a cry of anguish, a moan. The insect utters it only in a moment of danger and
never, so far as I know, at the time of its wedding.
</p>
<p>The real musician, who expresses his gladness by strokes of the bow and cymbals, dates
much farther back. He preceded the insects endowed with a superior organization, the
Beetle, the Bee, the Fly, the Butterfly, who prove their higher rank by complete transformations;
he is closely connected with the rude beginnings of the geological period. The singing
insect, in fact, belongs exclusively either to the order of the Hemiptera, including
the Cicadæ, or to that of the Orthoptera, including the Grasshoppers and Crickets.
Its incomplete metamorphoses link it with those primitive races whose records are
inscribed in our coal-seams. It <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>is one of the first that mingled the sounds of life with the vague murmuring of inert
things. It was singing before the reptile had learnt to breathe.
</p>
<p>This shows, from the mere point of view of sound, the futility of those theories of
ours which try to explain the world by the automatic evolution of progress nascent
in the primitive cell. All is yet dumb; and already the insect is stridulating as
correctly as it does to-day. Phonetics start with an apparatus which the ages will
hand down to one another without changing any essential part of it. Then, though the
lungs have appeared, we have silence, save for the heavy breathing of the nostrils.
But lo, one day, the Frog croaks; and soon, with no preparation, there are mingled
with this hideous concert the trills of the Quail, the whistled stanzas of the Thrush
and the Warbler’s musical strains. The larynx in its highest form has come into existence.
What will the late-comers do with it? The Ass and the Wild Boar give us our reply.
We find something worse than marking time, we find an enormous retrogression, until
one last bound brings us to man’s own larynx.
</p>
<p>In this genesis of sounds it is impossible to <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>talk authoritatively of a steady progression which makes the middling follow on the
bad and the excellent on the middling. We see nothing but abrupt excursions, intermittences,
recoils, sudden expansions not foretold by what has gone before nor continued by that
which follows; we find nothing but a riddle whose solution does not lie in the virtues
of the cell alone, that easy pillow for whoso has not the courage to search deeper.
</p>
<p>But let us leave the question of origins, that inaccessible domain, and come down
to facts; let us cross-examine a few representatives of those old races who were the
earliest exponents of the art of sounds and took it into their heads to sing at a
time when the mud of the first continents was hardening; let us ask them how their
instrument is constructed and what is the object of their ditty.
</p>
<p>The Grasshopper, so remarkable both for the length and thickness of her hinder thighs
and for her ovipositor, the sabre or dibble which plants her eggs, is one of the chief
performers in the entomological concert. Indeed, if we except the Cicada, who is often
confused with her, she is responsible for the greater part of the noise. Only one
of the Orthoptera surpasses her; and that is <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>the Cricket, her near neighbour. Let us first listen to the White-faced Decticus.
</p>
<p>The performance begins with a hard, sharp, almost metallic sound, very like that emitted
by the Thrush keeping a sharp look-out while he stuffs himself with olives. It consists
of a series of isolated notes, <i>tick-tick</i>, with a longish pause between them. Then, with a gradual <i>crescendo</i>, the song develops into a rapid clicking in which the fundamental <i>tick-tick</i> is accompanied by a continuous droning bass. At the end the <i>crescendo</i> becomes so loud that the metallic note disappears and the sound is transformed into
a mere rustle, a <i>frrrr-frrrr-frrrr</i> of the greatest rapidity.
</p>
<p>The performer goes on like this for hours, with alternating strophes and rests. In
calm weather, the song, at its height, can be heard twenty steps away. That is no
great distance. The noise made by the Cicada and the Cricket carries much farther.
</p>
<p>How are the strains produced? The books which I am able to consult leave me perplexed.
They tell me of the “mirror,” a thin, quivering membrane which glistens like a blade
of mica; but how is this membrane made to vibrate? That is what they <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>either do not tell us or else tell us very vaguely and inaccurately, talking of a
friction of the wing-cases, mutual rubbing of the nervures; and that is all.
</p>
<p>I should like a more lucid explanation, for a Grasshopper’s musical-box, I feel certain
in advance, must have an exact mechanism of its own. Let us therefore look into the
matter, even though we have to repeat observations already perhaps made by others,
but unknown to a recluse like myself, whose whole library consists of a few old odd
volumes.
</p>
<p>The Decticus’ wing-cases widen at the base and form on the insect’s back a flat sunken
surface shaped like an elongated triangle. This is the sounding-board. Here the left
wing-case folds over the right and, when at rest, completely covers the latter’s musical
apparatus. The most distinct and, from time immemorial, the best-known part of it
is the mirror, thus called because of the shininess of its thin oval membrane, set
in the frame of a nervure. It is very like the skin of a drum, of an exquisitely delicate
tympanum, with this difference, that it sounds without being tapped. Nothing touches
the mirror when the Decticus sings. Its vibrations <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>are imparted to it after starting elsewhere. And how? I will tell you.
</p>
<p>Its edging is prolonged at the inner angle of the base by a wide, blunt tooth, furnished
at the end with a more prominent and powerful fold than the other nervures distributed
here and there. I will call this fold the friction-nervure. This is the starting-point
of the concussion that makes the mirror resound. The evidence will appear when the
remainder of the apparatus is known.
</p>
<p>This remainder, the motor mechanism, is on the left wing-case, covering the other
with its flat edge. Outside, there is nothing remarkable, unless it be—and even then
one has to be on the look-out for it—a sort of slightly slanting, transversal pad,
which might very easily be taken for a thicker nervure than the others.
</p>
<p>But examine the lower surface through the magnifying-glass. The pad is much more than
an ordinary nervure. It is an instrument of the highest precision, a magnificent indented
bow, marvellously regular on its diminutive scale. Never did human industry, when
cutting metal for the most delicate clockwork mechanism, achieve such perfection.
Its shape is that of a curved spindle. <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>From one end to the other there have been cut across this bow about eighty triangular
teeth, which are very even and are of some hard, durable material, dark-brown in colour.
</p>
<p>The use of this mechanical gem is obvious. If we take a dead Decticus and lift the
flat rim of the two wing-cases slightly in order to place them in the position which
they occupy when sounding, we see the bow fitting its indentations to the terminal
nervure which I have called the friction-nervure; we follow the line of teeth which,
from end to end of the row, never swerve from the points to be set in motion; and,
if the operation be done at all dexterously, the dead insect sings, that is to say,
strikes a few of its clicking notes.
</p>
<p>The secret of the sounds produced by the Decticus is out. The toothed bow of the left
wing-case is the motor; the friction-nervure of the right wing-case is the point of
concussion; the stretched membrane of the mirror is the resonator, to which vibration
is communicated by the shaking of the surrounding frame. Our own music has many vibrating
membranes; but these are always affected by direct percussion. Bolder than <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>our makers of musical instruments, the Decticus combines the bow with the drum.
</p>
<p>The same combination is found in the other Grasshoppers. The most famous of these
is the Green Grasshopper (<i lang="la">Locusta viridissima</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), who to the qualities of a handsome stature and a fine green colour adds the honour
of classical renown. In La Fontaine she is the Cicada who comes alms-begging of the
Ant when the north wind blows. Flies and Grubs being scarce, the would-be borrower
asks for a few grains to live upon until next summer. The double diet, animal and
vegetable, is a very happy inspiration on the fabulist’s part.
</p>
<p>The Grasshopper, in fact, has the same tastes as the Decticus. In my cages, he feeds
on lettuce-leaves when there is nothing better going; but his preference is all in
favour of the Locust, whom he crunches up without leaving anything but the wing-cases
and wings. In a state of liberty, his preying on that ravenous browser must largely
make up to us for the small toll which he levies on our agricultural produce.
</p>
<p>Except in a few details, his musical instrument is the same as that of the Decticus.
It occupies, at the base of the wing-cases, a <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>large sunken surface shaped like a curved triangle and brownish in colour, with a
dull-yellow rim. It is a sort of escutcheon, emblazoned with heraldic devices. On
the under surface of the left wing-case, which is folded over the right, two transversal,
parallel grooves are cut. The space between them makes a ridge which constitutes the
bow. The latter, a brown spindle, has a set of fine, very regular and very numerous
teeth. The mirror of the right wing-case is almost circular, well framed and supplied
with a strong and prominent friction-nervure.
</p>
<p>The insect stridulates in July and August, in the evening twilight, until close upon
ten o’clock. It produces a quick, rattling noise, accompanied by a faint metallic
clicking which barely passes the border of perceptible sounds. The abdomen, considerably
lowered, throbs and beats the measure. This goes on for irregular periods and suddenly
ceases; in between these periods there are false starts reduced to a few strokes of
the bow; there are pauses and then the stridulation is once more in full swing.
</p>
<p>All said, it is a very meagre performance, greatly inferior in volume to that of the
Decticus, not to be compared with the song of <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>the Cricket and even less with the harsh and noisy efforts of the Cicada. In the quiet
of the evening, when only a few steps away, I need little Paul’s delicate ear to apprise
me of it.
</p>
<p>It is poorer still in the two dwarf Dectici of my neighbourhood, <i lang="la">Platycleis intermedia</i>, <span class="sc">Serv.</span>, and <i lang="la">P. grisea</i>, <span class="sc">Fab.</span>, both of whom are common in the long grass, where the ground is stony and exposed
to the sun, and quick to disappear in the undergrowth when you try to catch them.
These two fat songsters have each had the doubtful privilege of a place in my cages.
</p>
<p>Here, in a blazing sun beating straight upon the window, are my little Dectici crammed
with green millet-seeds and also with game. Most of them are lying in the hottest
places, on their bellies or sides, with their hind-legs outstretched. For hours on
end they digest without moving and slumber in their voluptuous attitude. Some of them
sing. Oh, what a feeble song!
</p>
<p>The ditty of the Intermediary Decticus, with its strophes and pauses alternating at
equal intervals, is a rapid <i>fr-r-r-r</i> similar to the Coaltit’s, while that of the Grey Decticus consists of distinct strokes
of the bow and <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>tends to copy the Cricket’s melody, with a note which is hoarser and, in particular,
much fainter. In both cases, the feebleness of the sound hardly allows me to hear
the singer a couple of yards away.
</p>
<p>And to produce this music, this insignificant and only just perceptible refrain, the
two dwarfs have all that their big cousin possesses: a toothed bow, a tambourine,
a friction-nervure. On the bow of the Grey Decticus I count about forty teeth and
eighty on that of the Intermediary Decticus. Moreover, in both, the right wing-case
displays, around the mirror, a few diaphanous spaces, intended no doubt to increase
the extent of the vibrating portion. It makes no difference: though the instrument
is magnificent, the production of sound is very poor.
</p>
<p>With this same mechanism of a drum and file, which of them will achieve any progress?
Not one of the large-winged Locustidæ succeeds in doing so. All, from the biggest,
the Grasshoppers, Dectici and Conocephali, down to the smallest, the Platycleis, Xiphidion
and Phaneropteron, set in motion with the teeth of a bow the frame of a vibrating-mirror;
all are, so to speak, left-handed, that is to say, they carry the bow on the lower
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>surface of the left wing-case, overlapping the right, which is furnished with the
tympanum; all, lastly, have a thin, faint trill which is sometimes hardly perceptible.
</p>
<p>One alone, modifying the details of the apparatus without introducing any innovation
into the general structure, achieves a certain power of sound. This is the Vine Ephippiger,
who does without wings and reduces his wing-cases to two concave scales, elegantly
fluted and fitting one into the other. These two disks are all that remains of the
organs of flight, which have become exclusively organs of song. The insect abandons
flying to devote itself the better to stridulation.
</p>
<p>It shelters its instrument under a sort of dome formed by the corselet, which is curved
saddlewise. As usual, the left scale occupies the upper position and bears on its
lower surface a file in which we can distinguish with the lens eighty transversal
denticulations, more powerful and more clearly cut than those possessed by any other
of the Grasshopper tribe. The right scale is underneath. At the top of its slightly
flattened dome, the mirror gleams, framed in a strong nervure.
</p>
<p>For elegance of structure, this instrument <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>is superior to the Cicada’s, in which the contraction of two columns of muscles alternately
pulls in and lets out the convex surface of two barren cymbals. It needs sound-chambers,
resonators, to become a noisy apparatus. As things are, it emits a lingering and plaintive
<i>tchi-i-i, tchi-i-i, tchi-i-i</i>, in a minor key, which is heard even farther than the blithe bowing of the White-faced
Decticus.
</p>
<p>When disturbed in their repose, the Decticus and the other Grasshoppers at once become
silent, struck dumb with fear. With them, singing invariably expresses gladness. The
Ephippiger also dreads to be disturbed and baffles with his sudden silence whoso seeks
to find him. But take him between your fingers. Often he will resume his stridulation
with erratic strokes of the bow. At such times the song denotes anything but happiness,
fear rather and all the anguish of danger. The Cicada likewise rattles more shrilly
than ever when a ruthless child dislocates his abdomen and forces open his chapels.
In both cases, the gay refrain of the mirthful insect turns into the lamentation of
a persecuted victim.
</p>
<p>A second peculiarity of the Ephippiger’s, <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>unknown to the other singing insects, is worthy of remark. Both sexes are endowed
with the sound-producing apparatus. The female, who, in the other Grasshoppers, is
always dumb, with not even a vestige of bow or mirror, acquires in this instance a
musical instrument which is a close copy of the male’s.
</p>
<p>The left scale covers the right. Its edges are fluted with thick, pale nervures, forming
a fine-meshed network; the centre, on the other hand, is smooth and swells into an
amber-coloured dome. Underneath, this dome is supplied with two concurrent nervures,
the chief of which is slightly wrinkled on its ridge. The right scale is similarly
constructed, but for one detail: the central dome, which also is amber-coloured, is
traversed by a nervure which describes a sort of sinuous line and which, under the
magnifying-glass, reveals very fine transversal teeth throughout the greater part
of its length.
</p>
<p>This feature betrays the bow, placed in the inverse position to that which is known
to us. The male is left-handed and works with his upper wing-case; the female is right-handed
and scrapes with her lower wing-case. <span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>Besides, with her, there is no such thing as a mirror, that is to say, no shiny membrane
resembling a flake of mica. The bow rubs across the rough vein of the opposite scale
and in this way produces simultaneous vibration in the two fitted spherical domes.
</p>
<p>The vibrating part is double, therefore, but too stiff and clumsy to produce a sound
of any depth. The song, in any case rather thin, is even more plaintive than the male’s.
The insect is not lavish with it. If I do not interfere, my captives never add their
note to the concert of their caged companions; on the other hand, when seized and
worried, they utter a moan at once. It seems likely that, in a state of liberty, things
happen otherwise. The dumb beauties in my bell-jars are not for nothing endowed with
a double cymbal and a bow. The instrument that moans with fright must also ring out
joyously on occasion.
</p>
<p>What purpose is served by the Grasshopper’s sound-apparatus? I will not go so far
as to refuse it a part in the pairing, or to deny it a persuasive murmur, sweet to
her who hears it: that would be flying in the face of the evidence. But this is not
its principal <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>function. Before anything else, the insect uses it to express its joy in living, to
sing the delights of existence with a belly well filled and a back warmed by the sun,
as witness the big Decticus and the male Grasshopper, who, after the wedding, exhausted
for good and all and taking no further interest in pairing, continue to stridulate
merrily as long as their strength holds out.
</p>
<p>The Grasshopper tribe has its bursts of gladness; it has moreover the advantage of
being able to express them with a sound, the simple satisfaction of the artist. The
little journeyman whom I see in the evening returning from the workyard on his way
home, where his supper awaits him, whistles and sings for his own pleasure, with no
intention of making himself heard, nor any wish to attract an audience. In his artless
and almost unconscious fashion, he tells the joys of a hard day’s work done and of
his plateful of steaming cabbage. Even so most often does the singing insect stridulate:
it is celebrating life.
</p>
<p>Some go farther. If existence has its sweets, it also has its sorrows. The saddle-bearing
Grasshopper of the vines is able to <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>translate both of these into sound. In a trailing melody, he sings to the bushes of
his happiness; in a like melody, hardly altered, he pours forth his griefs and his
fears. His mate, herself an instrumentalist, shares this privilege. She exults and
laments with two cymbals of another pattern.
</p>
<p>When all is said, the cogged drum need not be looked down upon. It enlivens the lawns,
murmurs the joys and tribulations of existence, sends the lover’s call echoing all
around, brightens the weary waiting of the lonely ones, tells of the perfect blossoming
of insect life. Its stroke of the bow is almost a voice.
</p>
<p>And this magnificent gift, so full of promise, is granted only to the inferior races,
coarse natures, near akin to the crude beginnings of the carboniferous period. If,
as we are told, the superior insect descends from ancestors who have been gradually
transformed, why did it not preserve that fine inheritance of a voice which has sounded
from the earliest ages?
</p>
<p>Can it be that the theory of progressive acquirements is only a specious lure? Are
we to abandon the savage theory of the crushing of the weak by the strong, of the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>less well-endowed by their more highly-gifted rivals? Is it permissible to doubt,
when the evolutionists talk to us of the survival of the fittest? Yes, indeed it is!
</p>
<p>We are told as much by a certain Libellula of the carboniferous age (<i lang="la">Meganeura Monyi</i>, <span class="sc">Brong.</span>), measuring over two feet across the wings. The giant Dragon-fly, who terrified the
small winged folk with her sawlike mandibles, has disappeared, whereas the puny Agrion,
with her bronze or azure abdomen, still hovers over the reeds of our rivers.
</p>
<p>So have her contemporaries disappeared, the monstrous sauroid fishes, mailed in enamel
and armed to the teeth. Their scarce successors are mere abortions. The splendid series
of Cephalopods with partitioned shells, including certain Ammonites of the diameter
of a cartwheel, has no other representative in our present seas than that modest fireman’s
helmet, the Nautilus. The Megalosaurus, a saurian twenty-five yards long, was a more
alarming figure in our country-sides than the Grey Lizard of the walls. One of man’s
contemporaries, that monumental beast the Mammoth, is known only by his remains; and
his near kinsman <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>the Elephant, a mere Sheep beside him, goes on prospering. What a shock to the law
of the survival of the strongest! The mighty have gone under; and the weak fill their
place.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We are in the middle of July. The astronomical dog-days are just beginning; but in
reality the torrid season has anticipated the calendar and for some weeks past the
heat has been overpowering.
</p>
<p>This evening in the village they are celebrating the National Festival.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3040src" href="#xd31e3040">1</a> While the little boys and girls are hopping around a bonfire whose gleams are reflected
upon the church-steeple, while the drum is pounded to mark the ascent of each rocket,
I am sitting alone in a dark corner, in the comparative coolness that prevails at
nine o’clock, harking to the concert of the festival of the fields, the festival of
the harvest, grander by far than that which, at this moment, is being celebrated in
the village square with gun-powder, lighted torches, Chinese lanterns <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>and, above all, strong drink. It has the simplicity of beauty and the repose of strength.
</p>
<p>It is late; and the Cicadæ are silent. Glutted with light and heat, they have indulged
in symphonies all the livelong day. The advent of the night means rest for them, but
a rest frequently disturbed. In the dense branches of the plane-trees, a sudden sound
rings out like a cry of anguish, strident and short. It is the desperate wail of the
Cicada, surprised in his quietude by the Green Grasshopper, that ardent nocturnal
huntress, who springs upon him, grips him in the side, opens and ransacks his abdomen.
An orgy of music, followed by butchery.
</p>
<p>I have never seen and never shall see that supreme expression of our national revelry,
the military review at Longchamp; nor do I much regret it. The newspapers tell me
as much about it as I want to know. They give me a sketch of the site. I see, installed
here and there amid the trees, the ominous Red Cross, with the legend, “Military Ambulance;
Civil Ambulance.” There will be bones broken, apparently; cases of sunstroke; regrettable
deaths, perhaps. It is all provided for and all in the programme.
</p>
<p>Even here, in my village, usually so peaceable, <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>the festival will not end, I am ready to wager, without the exchange of a few blows,
that compulsory seasoning of a day of merry-making. No pleasure, it appears, can be
fully relished without an added condiment of pain.
</p>
<p>Let us listen and meditate far from the tumult. While the disembowelled Cicada utters
his protest, the festival up there in the plane-trees is continued with a change of
orchestra. It is now the time of the nocturnal performers. Hard by the place of slaughter,
in the green bushes, a delicate ear perceives the hum of the Grasshoppers. It is the
sort of noise that a spinning-wheel makes, a very unobtrusive sound, a vague rustle
of dry membranes rubbed together. Above this dull bass there rises, at intervals,
a hurried, very shrill, almost metallic clicking. There you have the air and the recitative,
intersected by pauses. The rest is the accompaniment.
</p>
<p>Despite the assistance of a bass, it is a poor concert, very poor indeed, though there
are about ten executants in my immediate vicinity. The tone lacks intensity. My old
tympanum is not always capable of perceiving these subtleties of sound. The little
that <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>reaches me is extremely sweet and most appropriate to the calm of twilight. Just a
little more breadth in your bow-stroke, my dear Green Grasshopper, and your technique
would be better than the hoarse Cicada’s, whose name and reputation you have been
made to usurp in the countries of the north.
</p>
<p>Still, you will never equal your neighbour, the little bell-ringing Toad, who goes
tinkling all round, at the foot of the plane-trees, while you click up above. He is
the smallest of my batrachian folk and the most venturesome in his expeditions.
</p>
<p>How often, at nightfall, by the last glimmers of daylight, have I not come upon him
as I wandered through my garden, hunting for ideas! Something runs away, rolling over
and over in front of me. Is it a dead leaf blown along by the wind? No, it is the
pretty little Toad disturbed in the midst of his pilgrimage. He hurriedly takes shelter
under a stone, a clod of earth, a tuft of grass, recovers from his excitement and
loses no time in picking up his liquid note.
</p>
<p>On this evening of national rejoicing, there are nearly a dozen of him tinkling against
one another around me. Most of them are crouching among the rows of <span class="pageNum" id="pb279">[<a href="#pb279">279</a>]</span>flower-pots that form a sort of lobby outside my house. Each has his own note, always
the same, lower in one case, higher in another, a short, clear note, melodious and
of exquisite purity.
</p>
<p>With their slow, rhythmical cadence, they seem to be intoning litanies. <i>Cluck</i>, says one; <i>click</i>, responds another, on a finer note; <i>clock</i>, adds a third, the tenor of the band. And this is repeated indefinitely, like the
bells of the village pealing on a holiday: <i>cluck, click, clock; cluck, click, clock</i>!
</p>
<p>The batrachian choristers remind me of a certain harmonica which I used to covet when
my six-year-old ear began to awaken to the magic of sounds. It consisted of a series
of strips of glass of unequal length, hung on two stretched tapes. A cork fixed to
a wire served as a hammer. Imagine an unskilled hand striking at random on this key-board,
with a sudden clash of octaves, dissonances and topsy-turvy chords; and you will have
a pretty clear idea of the Toads’ litany.
</p>
<p>As a song, this litany has neither head nor tail to it; as a collection of pure sounds,
it is delicious. This is the case with all the music in nature’s concerts. Our ear
discovers <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>superb notes in it and then becomes refined and acquires, outside the realities of
sound, that sense of order which is the first condition of beauty.
</p>
<p>Now this sweet ringing of bells between hiding-place and hiding-place is the matrimonial
oratorio, the discreet summons which every Jack issues to his Jill. The sequel to
the concert may be guessed without further enquiry; but what it would be impossible
to foresee is the strange finale of the wedding. Behold the father, in this case a
real <i>pater-familias</i>, in the noblest sense of the word, coming out of his retreat one day in an unrecognizable
state. He is carrying the future, tight-packed around his hind-legs; he is changing
houses laden with a cluster of eggs the size of pepper-corns. His calves are girt,
his thighs are sheathed with the bulky burden; and it covers his back like a beggar’s
wallet, completely deforming him.
</p>
<p>Whither is he going, dragging himself along, incapable of jumping, thanks to the weight
of his load? He is going, the fond parent, where the mother refuses to go; he is on
his way to the nearest pond, whose warm waters are indispensable to the tadpoles’
hatching and existence. When the <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>eggs are nicely ripened around his legs under the humid shelter of a stone, he braves
the damp and the daylight, he the passionate lover of dry land and darkness; he advances
by short stages, his lungs congested with fatigue. The pond is far away, perhaps;
no matter: the plucky pilgrim will find it.
</p>
<p>He’s there. Without delay, he dives, despite his profound antipathy to bathing; and
the cluster of eggs is instantly removed by the legs rubbing against each other. The
eggs are now in their element; and the rest will be accomplished of itself. Having
fulfilled his obligation to go right under, the father hastens to return to his well-sheltered
home. He is scarcely out of sight before the little black tadpoles are hatched and
playing about. They were but waiting for the contact of the water in order to burst
their shells.
</p>
<p>Among the singers in the July gloaming, one alone, were he able to vary his notes,
could vie with the Toad’s harmonious bells. This is the little Scops-owl, that comely
nocturnal bird of prey, with the round gold eyes. He sports on his forehead two small
feathered horns which have won for him in the district the name of <i lang="la">Machoto banarudo</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>the Horned Owl. His song, which is rich enough to fill by itself the still night air,
is of a nerve-shattering monotony. With imperturbable and measured regularity, for
hours on end, <i>kew, kew</i>, the bird spits out its cantata to the moon.
</p>
<p>One of them has arrived at this moment, driven from the plane-trees in the square
by the din of the rejoicings, to demand my hospitality. I can hear him in the top
of a cypress near by. From up there, dominating the lyrical assembly, at regular intervals
he cuts into the vague orchestration of the Grasshoppers and the Toads.
</p>
<p>His soft note is contrasted, intermittently, with a sort of Cat’s mew, coming from
another spot. This is the call of the Common Owl, the meditative bird of Minerva.
After hiding all day in the seclusion of a hollow olive-tree, he started on his wanderings
when the shades of evening began to fall. Swinging along with a sinuous flight, he
came from somewhere in the neighbourhood to the pines in my enclosure, whence he mingles
his harsh mewing, slightly softened by distance, with the general concert.
</p>
<p>The Green Grasshopper’s clicking is too faint to be clearly perceived amidst these
<span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>clamourers; all that reaches me is the least ripple, just noticeable when there is
a moment’s silence. He possesses as his apparatus of sound only a modest drum and
scraper, whereas they, more highly privileged, have their bellows, the lungs, which
send forth a column of vibrating air. There is no comparison possible. Let us return
to the insects.
</p>
<p>One of these, though inferior in size and no less sparingly equipped, greatly surpasses
the Grasshopper in nocturnal rhapsodies. I speak of the pale and slender Italian Cricket
(<i lang="la">Œcanthus pellucens</i>, <span class="sc">Scop.</span>), who is so puny that you dare not take him up for fear of crushing him. He makes
music everywhere among the rosemary-bushes, while the Glow-worms light up their blue
lamps to complete the revels. The delicate instrumentalist consists chiefly of a pair
of large wings, thin and gleaming as strips of mica. Thanks to these dry sails, he
fiddles away with an intensity capable of drowning the Toads’ fugue. His performance
suggests, but with more brilliancy, more <i>tremolo</i> in the execution, the song of the Common Black Cricket. Indeed the mistake would
certainly be made by any one who did not <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>know that, by the time that the very hot weather comes, the true Cricket, the chorister
of spring, has disappeared. His pleasant violin has been succeeded by another more
pleasant still and worthy of special study. We shall return to him at an opportune
moment.
</p>
<p>These then, limiting ourselves to select specimens, are the principal participants
in this musical evening: the Scops-owl, with his languorous solos; the Toad, that
tinkler of sonatas; the Italian Cricket, who scrapes the first string of a violin;
and the Green Grasshopper, who seems to beat a tiny steel triangle.
</p>
<p>We are celebrating to-day, with greater uproar than conviction, the new era, dating
politically from the fall of the Bastille; they, with glorious indifference to human
things, are celebrating the festival of the sun, singing the happiness of existence,
sounding the loud hosanna of the July heats.
</p>
<p>What care they for man and his fickle rejoicings! For whom or for what will our squibs
be spluttering a few years hence? Far-seeing indeed would he be who could answer the
question. Fashions change and bring us the unexpected. The time-serving <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>rocket spreads its sheaf of sparks for the public enemy of yesterday, who has become
the idol of to-day. To-morrow it will go up for somebody else.
</p>
<p>In a century or two, will any one, outside the historians, give a thought to the taking
of the Bastille? It is very doubtful. We shall have other joys and also other cares.
</p>
<p>Let us look a little farther ahead. A day will come, so everything seems to tell us,
when, after making progress upon progress, man will succumb, destroyed by the excess
of what he calls civilization. Too eager to play the god, he cannot hope for the animal’s
placid longevity; he will have disappeared when the little Toad is still saying his
litany, in company with the Grasshopper, the Scops-owl and the others. They were singing
on this planet before us; they will sing after us, celebrating what can never change,
the fiery glory of the sun.
</p>
<p>I will dwell no longer on this festival and will become once more the naturalist,
anxious to obtain information concerning the private life of the insect. The Green
Grasshopper (<i lang="la">Locusta viridissima</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>) does not appear to be common in my neighbourhood. Last year, intending to make a
study of this insect <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>and finding my efforts to hunt it fruitless, I was obliged to have recourse to the
good offices of a forest-ranger, who sent me a pair of couples from the Lagarde plateau,
that bleak district where the beech-tree begins its escalade of the Ventoux.
</p>
<p>Now and then freakish fortune takes it into her head to smile upon the persevering.
What was not to be found last year has become almost common this summer. Without leaving
my narrow enclosure, I obtain as many Grasshoppers as I could wish. I hear them rustling
at night in the green thickets. Let us make the most of the windfall, which perhaps
will not occur again.
</p>
<p>In the month of June, my treasures are installed, in a sufficient number of couples,
under a wire cover standing on a bed of sand in an earthen pan. It is indeed a magnificent
insect, pale-green all over, with two whitish stripes running down its sides. Its
imposing size, its slim proportions and its great gauze wings make it the most elegant
of our Locustidæ. I am enraptured with my captives. What will they teach me? We shall
see. For the moment, we must feed them.
</p>
<p>I have here the same difficulty that I had <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>with the Decticus. Influenced by the general diet of the Orthoptera,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3140src" href="#xd31e3140">2</a> those ruminants of the greenswards, I offer the prisoners a leaf of lettuce. They
bite into it, certainly, but very sparingly and with a scornful tooth. It soon becomes
plain that I am dealing with half-hearted vegetarians. They want something else: they
are beasts of prey, apparently. But what manner of prey? A lucky chance taught me.
</p>
<p>At break of day I was pacing up and down outside my door, when something fell from
the nearest plane-tree with a shrill grating sound. I ran up and saw a Grasshopper
gutting the belly of an exhausted Cicada. In vain the victim buzzed and waved his
limbs: the other did not let go, dipping her head right into the entrails and rooting
them out by small mouthfuls.
</p>
<p>I knew what I wanted to know: the attack had taken place up above, early in the morning,
while the Cicada was asleep; and the plunging of the poor wretch, dissected alive,
had made assailant and assailed fall in a <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>bundle to the ground. Since then I have repeatedly had occasion to witness similar
carnage.
</p>
<p>I have even seen the Grasshopper—the height of audacity, this—dart in pursuit of a
Cicada in mad flight. Even so does the Sparrow-hawk pursue the Swallow in the sky.
But the bird of prey here is inferior to the insect. It attacks a weaker than itself.
The Grasshopper, on the other hand, assaults a colossus, much larger than herself
and stronger; and nevertheless the result of the unequal fight is not in doubt. The
Grasshopper rarely fails with the sharp pliers of her powerful jaws to disembowel
her capture, which, being unprovided with weapons, confines itself to crying out and
kicking.
</p>
<p>The main thing is to retain one’s hold of the prize, which is not difficult in somnolent
darkness. Any Cicada encountered by the fierce Locustid on her nocturnal rounds is
bound to die a lamentable death. This explains those sudden agonized notes which grate
through the woods at late, unseasonable hours, when the cymbals have long been silent.
The murderess in her suit of apple-green has pounced on some sleeping Cicada.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>My boarders’ menu is settled: I will feed them on Cicadæ. They take such a liking
to this fare that, in two or three weeks, the floor of the cage is a knacker’s yard
strewn with heads and empty thoraces, with torn-off wings and disjointed legs. The
belly alone disappears almost entirely. This is the tit-bit, not very substantial,
but extremely tasty, it would seem. Here, in fact, in the insect’s crop, the syrup
is accumulated, the sugary sap which the Cicada’s gimlet taps from the tender bark.
Is it because of this dainty that the prey’s abdomen is preferred to any other morsel?
It is quite possible.
</p>
<p>I do, in fact, with a view to varying the diet, decide to serve up some very sweet
fruits, slices of pear, grape-pips, bits of melon. All this meets with delighted appreciation.
The Green Grasshopper resembles the English: she dotes on underdone rumpsteak seasoned
with jam.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3157src" href="#xd31e3157">3</a> This perhaps is <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>why, on catching the Cicada, she first rips up his paunch, which supplies a mixture
of flesh and preserves.
</p>
<p>To eat Cicadæ and sugar is not possible in every part of the country. In the north,
where she abounds, the Green Grasshopper would not find the dish which attracts her
so strongly here. She must have other resources. To convince myself of this, I give
her Anoxiæ (<i lang="la">A. pilosa</i>, <span class="sc">Fab.</span>), the summer equivalent of the spring Cockchafer. The Beetle is accepted without
hesitation. Nothing is left of him but the wing-cases, head and legs. The result is
the same with the magnificent plump Pine Cockchafer (<i lang="la">Melolontha fullo</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), a sumptuous morsel which I find next day eviscerated by my gang of knackers.
</p>
<p>These examples teach us enough. They tell us that the Grasshopper is an inveterate
consumer of insects, especially of those which are not protected by too hard a cuirass;
they are evidence of tastes which <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>are highly carnivorous, but not exclusively so, like those of the Praying Mantis,
who refuses everything except game. The butcher of the Cicadæ is able to modify an
excessively heating diet with vegetable fare. After meat and blood, sugary fruit-pulp;
sometimes even, for lack of anything better, a little green stuff.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, cannibalism is prevalent. True, I never witness in my Grasshopper-cages
the savagery which is so common in the Praying Mantis, who harpoons her rivals and
devours her lovers; but, if some weakling succumb, the survivors hardly ever fail
to profit by his carcass as they would in the case of any ordinary prey. With no scarcity
of provisions as an excuse, they feast upon their defunct companion. For the rest,
all the sabre-bearing clan display, in varying degrees, a propensity for filling their
bellies with their maimed comrades.
</p>
<p>In other respects, the Grasshoppers live together very peacefully in my cages. No
serious strife ever takes place among them, nothing beyond a little rivalry in the
matter of food. I hand in a piece of pear. A Grasshopper alights on it at once. Jealously
she kicks away any one trying to bite at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>delicious morsel. Selfishness reigns everywhere. When she has eaten her fill, she
makes way for another, who in her turn becomes intolerant. One after the other, all
the inmates of the menagerie come and refresh themselves. After cramming their crops,
they scratch the soles of their feet a little with their mandibles, polish up their
forehead and eyes with a leg moistened with spittle and then, hanging to the trelliswork
or lying on the sand in a posture of contemplation, blissfully they digest and slumber
most of the day, especially during the hottest part of it.
</p>
<p>It is in the evening, after sunset, that the troop becomes lively. By nine o’clock
the animation is at its height. With sudden rushes they clamber to the top of the
dome, to descend as hurriedly and climb up once more. They come and go tumultuously,
run and hop around the circular track and, without stopping, nibble at the good things
on the way.
</p>
<p>The males are stridulating by themselves, here and there, teasing the passing fair
with their antennæ. The future mothers stroll about gravely, with their sabre half-raised.
The agitation and feverish excitement means <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>that the great business of pairing is at hand. The fact will escape no practised eye.
</p>
<p>It is also what I particularly wish to observe. My chief object in stocking my cages
was to discover how far the strange nuptial manners revealed by the White-faced Decticus
might be regarded as general. My wish is satisfied, but not fully, for the late hours
at which events take place did not allow me to witness the final act of the wedding.
It is late at night or early in the morning that things happen.
</p>
<p>The little that I see is confined to interminable preludes. Standing face to face,
with foreheads almost touching, the lovers feel and sound each other for a long time
with their limp antennæ. They suggest two fencers crossing and recrossing harmless
foils. From time to time, the male stridulates a little, gives a few short strokes
of the bow and then falls silent, feeling perhaps too much overcome to continue. Eleven
o’clock strikes; and the declaration is not yet over. Very regretfully, but conquered
by sleepiness, I quit the couple.
</p>
<p>Next morning, early, the female carries, hanging at the bottom of her ovipositor,
the queer bladderlike arrangement that surprised <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>us so much in the Decticus. It is an opaline capsule, the size of a large pea and
roughly subdivided into a small number of egg-shaped vesicles. When the Grasshopper
walks, the thing scrapes along the ground and becomes dirty with sticky grains of
sand.
</p>
<p>The final banquet of the female Decticus is seen again here in all its hideousness.
When, after a couple of hours, the fertilizing capsule is drained of its contents,
the Grasshopper devours it bit by bit; for a long time she chews and rechews the gummy
morsel and ends by swallowing it all down. In less than half a day, the milky burden
has disappeared, consumed with zest down to the last atom.
</p>
<p>The inconceivable therefore, imported, one would think, from another planet, so far
removed is it from earthly habits, reappears with no noticeable variation in the Grasshopper,
following on the Decticus. What singular folk are the Locustidæ, one of the oldest
races in the animal kingdom on dry land! It seems probable that these eccentricities
are the rule throughout the order. Let us consult another sabre-bearer.
</p>
<p>I select the Ephippiger (<i lang="la">Ephippigera vitium</i>, <span class="sc">Serv.</span>), who is so easy to rear on <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>bits of pear and lettuce-leaves. It is in July and August that things happen. A little
way off, the male is stridulating by himself. His ardent bow-strokes set his whole
body quivering. Then he stops. Little by little, with slow and almost ceremonious
steps, the caller and the called come closer together. They stand face to face, both
silent, both stationary, their antennæ gently swaying, their fore-legs raised awkwardly
and giving a sort of handshake at intervals. The peaceful interview lasts for hours.
What do they say to each other? What vows do they exchange? What does their ogling
mean?
</p>
<p>But the moment has not yet come. They separate, they fall out and each goes his own
way. The coolness does not last long. Here they are together again. The tender declarations
are resumed, with no more success than before. At last, on the third day, I behold
the end of the preliminaries. The male slips discreetly under his companion, backwards,
according to the immemorial laws and customs of the Crickets. Stretched out behind
and lying on his back, he clings to the ovipositor, his prop. The pairing is accomplished.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>The result is an enormous spermatophore, a sort of opalescent raspberry with large
seeds. Its colour and shape remind one of a cluster of Snail’s-eggs. I remember seeing
the same effect once with a Decticus, but in a less striking form; and I find it again
in the Green Grasshopper’s spermatophore. A thin median groove divides the whole into
two symmetrical bunches, each comprising seven or eight spherules. The two nodes situated
right and left of the bottom of the ovipositor are more transparent than the others
and contain a bright orange-red kernel. The whole thing is attached by a wide pedicle,
a dab of sticky jelly.
</p>
<p>As soon as the thing is placed in position, the shrunken male flees and goes to recruit,
after his disastrous prowess, on a slice of pear. The other, not at all troubled in
spite of her heavy load, wanders about on the trelliswork of the cage, taking very
short steps as she slightly raises her raspberry, this enormous burden, equal in bulk
to half the creature’s abdomen.
</p>
<p>Two or three hours pass in this way. Then the Ephippiger curves herself into a ring
and with her mandibles picks off particles of the nippled capsule, without bursting
<span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>it, of course, or allowing the contents to flow forth. She strips its surface by removing
tiny shreds, which she chews in a leisurely fashion and swallows. This fastidious
consuming by atoms is continued for a whole afternoon. Next day the raspberry has
disappeared; the whole of it has been gulped down during the night.
</p>
<p>At other times the end is less quick and, above all, less repulsive. I have kept a
note of an Ephippiger who was dragging her satchel along the ground and nibbling at
it from time to time. The soil is uneven and rugged, having been recently turned over
with the blade of a knife. The raspberry-like capsule picks up grains of sand and
little clods of earth, which increase the weight of the load considerably, though
the insect appears to pay no heed to it. Sometimes the carting becomes laborious,
because the load sticks to some bit of earth that refuses to move. In spite of the
efforts made to release the thing, it does not become detached from the point where
it hangs under the ovipositor, thus proving that it possesses no small power of adhesion.
</p>
<p>All through the evening, the Ephippiger roams about aimlessly, now on the wirework,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>anon on the ground, wearing a preoccupied air. Oftener still she stands without moving.
The capsule withers a little, but does not decrease notably in volume. There are no
more of those mouthfuls which the Ephippiger snatched at the beginning; and the little
that has already been removed affects only the surface.
</p>
<p>Next day, things are as they were. There is nothing new, nor on the morrow either,
save that the capsule withers still more, though its two red dots remain almost as
bright as at first. Finally, after sticking on for forty-eight hours, the whole thing
comes off without the insect’s intervention.
</p>
<p>The capsule has yielded its contents. It is a dried-up wreck, shrivelled beyond recognition,
left lying in the gutter and doomed sooner or later to become the booty of the Ants.
Why is it thus abandoned when, in other cases, I have seen the Ephippiger so greedy
for the morsel? Perhaps because the nuptial dish had become too gritty with grains
of sand, so unpleasant to the teeth.
</p>
<p>Another Locustid, the Phaneroptera who carries a short yataghan bent into a reaping-hook
(<i lang="la">P. falcata</i>, <span class="sc">Scop.</span>), has made up to me in part for my stud troubles. Repeatedly, <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>but always under conditions which did not allow of completing my observation, I have
caught her carrying the fertilizing-concern under the base of her sabre. It is a diaphanous,
oval phial, measuring three or four millimetres<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3243src" href="#xd31e3243">4</a> and hanging from a crystal thread, a neck almost as long as the distended part. The
insect does not touch it, but leaves the phial to dry up and shrivel where it is.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3247src" href="#xd31e3247">5</a>
</p>
<p>Let us be content with this. These five examples, furnished by such different genera,
Decticus, Analota, Grasshopper, Ephippiger and Phaneroptera, prove that the Locustid,
like the Scolopendra and the Cephalopod, is a belated representative of the manners
of antiquity, a valuable specimen of the genetic eccentricities of olden times.

<h2 class="main">THE CRICKET: THE BURROW; THE EGG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Almost as famous as the Cicada, the Field Cricket, the denizen of the greenswards,
figures among the limited but glorious number of the classic insects. He owes this
honour to his song and his house. One thing alone is lacking to complete his renown.
By a regrettable omission, the master of the art of making animals talk gives him
hardly two lines.
</p>
<p>In one of his fables he shows us the Hare seized with terror at the sight of his ears,
which scandalmongers will not fail to describe as horns at a time when to be horned
is dangerous. The prudent animal packs up his traps and makes off:
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>“Adieu, voisin Grillon,” dit-il; “je pars d’ici;</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>Mes oreilles enfin seraient cornes aussi.”</i> </p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cricket answers:
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>“Cornes cela! Vous me prenez pour cruche!</i> </p>
<p class="line"><i>Ce sont oreilles que Dieu fit.”</i> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Hare insists:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i lang="fr">“On les fera passer pour cornes.”</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3285src" href="#xd31e3285">1</a> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">And that is all. What a pity that La Fontaine did not make the insect hold forth at
greater length! The good-natured Cricket is depicted for us in a couple of lines which
already show the master’s touch. No, indeed, he is no fool: his big head might have
found some capital things to say. And yet the Hare was perhaps not wrong to take his
departure in a hurry. When slander is at your heels, the best thing is to fly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p>Florian<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3303src" href="#xd31e3303">2</a> was less concise in his story, which is on another theme; but what a long way we
are from the warmth and vigour of old La Fontaine! In Florian’s fable <i lang="fr">Le Grillon</i>, there are plenty of flowery meadows and blue skies; Dame Nature and affectation
go hand in hand; in short, we have the feeble artificialities of a lifeless rhetoric,
which loses sight of the thing described for the sake of the description. It lacks
the simplicity of truth and also the saving salt of humour.
</p>
<p>Besides, what a preposterous idea, to represent the Cricket as discontented, bewailing
his condition in despair! All who have studied him know, on the contrary, that he
is very well pleased with his own talent and his hole. This, moreover, is what the
fabulist makes him admit, after the Butterfly’s discomfiture:

</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>I find more force and more truth in the apologue by the nameless friend to whom I
owe the Provençal piece, <i lang="fr">La Cigalo e la Fournigo</i>. He will forgive me if for the second time I expose him, without his consent, to
the dangerous honour of print. Here it is:

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">There I recognize my Cricket. I see him curling his antennæ on the threshold of his
burrow, keeping his belly cool and his back to the sun. He is not jealous of the Butterfly;
on the contrary, he pities her, with that air of mocking commiseration familiar in
the ratepayer who owns a house of his own and sees passing before his door some wearer
of a gaudy costume with no place to lay her head. Far from complaining, he is very
well satisfied with both his house and his violin. A true philosopher, he knows the
vanity of things and appreciates the charm of a modest retreat away from the riot
of pleasure-seekers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yes, the description is about right, though it remains very inadequate and does not
bear the stamp of immortality. The Cricket is still waiting for the few lines needed
to perpetuate his merits; and, since La Fontaine neglected him, he will have to go
on waiting a long time.
</p>
<p>To me, as a naturalist, the outstanding feature in the two fables—a feature which
I should find repeated elsewhere, beyond a doubt, if my library were not reduced to
a small row of odd volumes on a deal shelf—is the burrow on which the moral is founded.
Florian speaks of the snug retreat; the other praises his lowly home. It is the dwelling
therefore that above all compels attention, even that of the poet, who cares little
in general for realities.
</p>
<p>In this respect, indeed, the Cricket is extraordinary. Of all our insects, he alone,
on attaining maturity, possesses a fixed abode, the monument of his industry. During
the bad season of the year, most of the others burrow or skulk in some temporary refuge,
a refuge obtained free of cost and abandoned without regret. Several create marvels,
with a view to settling their family: cotton satchels, baskets made of leaves, towers
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>cement. Some carnivorous larvæ dwell in permanent ambuscades, where they lie in wait
for their prey. The Tiger-beetle, among others, digs itself a perpendicular hole,
which it closes with its flat, bronze head. Whoever ventures on the insidious foot-bridge
vanishes down the gulf, whose trap-door at once tips up and disappears beneath the
feet of the wayfarer. The Ant-lion makes a funnel in the sand. The Ant slides down
its very loose slope and is bombarded with projectiles hurled from the bottom of the
crater by the hunter, who turns his neck into a catapult. But these are all temporary
refuges, nests or traps.
</p>
<p>The laboriously constructed residence, in which the insect settles down with no intention
of moving, either in the happy spring or the woful winter season; the real manor,
built for peace and comfort and not as a hunting-box or a nursery: this is known to
the Cricket alone. On some sunny, grassy slope he is the owner of a hermitage. While
all the others lead vagabond lives, sleeping in the open air or under the casual shelter
of a dead leaf, a stone, or the peeling bark of an old tree, he is a privileged person
with a permanent address.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>A serious problem is that of the home. It has been solved by the Cricket, by the Rabbit
and, lastly, by man. In my neighbourhood, the Fox and the Badger have holes the best
part of which is supplied by the irregularities of the rock. A few repairs; and the
dug-out is completed. Cleverer than they, the Rabbit builds his house by burrowing
wheresoever he pleases, when there is no natural passage that allows him to settle
down free of any trouble.
</p>
<p>The Cricket surpasses all of them. Scorning chance refuges, he always chooses the
site of his abode, in well-drained ground, with a pleasant sunny aspect. He refuses
to make use of fortuitous cavities, which are incommodious and rough; he digs every
bit of his villa, from the entrance-hall to the back-room.
</p>
<p>I see no one above him, in the art of house-building, except man; and even man, before
mixing mortar to hold stones together, before kneading clay to coat his hut of branches,
fought with wild beasts for the possession of a refuge in the rocks or an underground
cavern.
</p>
<p>Then how are the privileges of instinct distributed? Here is one of the humblest,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>able to lodge himself to perfection. He has a home, an advantage unknown to many civilized
beings; he has a peaceful retreat, the first condition of comfort; and nobody around
him is capable of settling down. He has no rivals until you come to ourselves.
</p>
<p>Whence does he derive this gift? Is he favoured with special tools? No, the Cricket
is not an incomparable excavator; in fact, one is rather surprised at the result when
one considers the feebleness of his resources.
</p>
<p>Can it be made necessary by the demands of an exceptionally delicate skin? No, among
his near kinsmen, other skins, no less sensitive than his, do not dread the open air
at all.
</p>
<p>Can it be a propensity inherent in the anatomical structure, a talent prescribed by
the secret promptings of the organism? No, my neighbourhood boasts three other Crickets
(<i lang="la">Gryllus bimaculatus</i>, <span class="sc">de Geer</span>; <i lang="la">G. desertus</i>, <span class="sc">Pallas.</span>; <i lang="la">G. burdigalensis</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e3461" title="Source: ;">,</span> <span class="sc">Latr.</span>), who are so like the Field Cricket in appearance, colour and structure that, at
the first glance, one would take them for him. The first is as large as he is, or
even larger. The second represents him reduced to about half <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>his size. The third is smaller still. Well, of these faithful copies, these doubles
of the Field Cricket, not one knows how to dig himself a burrow. The Double-spotted
Cricket inhabits those heaps of grass left to rot in damp places; the Solitary Cricket
roams about the crevices in the dry clods turned up by the gardener’s spade; the Bordeaux
Cricket is not afraid to make his way into our houses, where he sings discreetly,
during August and September, in some dark, cool spot.
</p>
<p>There is no object in continuing our questions: each would meet with no for an answer.
Instinct, which stands revealed here and disappears there despite organisms alike
in all respects, will never tell us its causes. It depends so little on an insect’s
stock of tools that no anatomical detail can explain it to us and still less make
us foresee it. The four almost identical Crickets, of whom one alone understands the
art of burrowing, add their evidence to the manifold proofs already supplied; they
confirm in a striking fashion our profound ignorance of the origin of instinct.
</p>
<p>Who does not know the Cricket’s abode! Who has not, as a child playing in <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>the fields, stopped in front of the hermit’s cabin! However light your footfall, he
has heard you coming and has abruptly withdrawn to the very bottom of his hiding-place.
When you arrive, the threshold of the house is deserted.
</p>
<p>Everybody knows the way to bring the skulker out. You insert a straw and move it gently
about the burrow. Surprised at what is happening above, tickled and teased, the Cricket
ascends from his secret apartment; he stops in the passage, hesitates and enquires
into things by waving his delicate antennæ; he comes to the light and, once outside,
he is easy to catch, so greatly have events puzzled his poor head. Should he be missed
at the first attempt, he may become more suspicious and obstinately resist the titillation
of the straw. In that case, we can flood him out with a glass of water.
</p>
<p>O those adorable times when we used to cage our Crickets and feed them on a leaf of
lettuce, those childish hunting-trips along the grassy paths! They all come back to
me to-day, as I explore the burrows in search of subjects for my studies; they appear
to me almost in their pristine freshness when my companion, little Paul, already an
expert in <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>the tactical use of the straw, springs up suddenly, after a long trial of skill and
patience with the recalcitrant, and, brandishing his closed hand in the air, cries,
excitedly:
</p>
<p>“I’ve got him, I’ve got him!”
</p>
<p>Quick, here’s a bag; in you go, my little Cricket! You shall be petted and pampered;
but mind you teach us something and, first of all, show us your house.
</p>
<p>It is a slanting gallery, situated in the grass, on some sunny bank which soon dries
after a shower. It is nine inches long at most, hardly as thick as one’s finger and
straight or bent according to the exigencies of the ground. As a rule, a tuft of grass,
which is respected by the Cricket when he goes out to browse upon the surrounding
turf, half-conceals the home, serving as a porch and throwing a discreet shade over
the entrance. The gently-sloping threshold, scrupulously raked and swept, is carried
for some distance. This is the belvedere on which, when everything is peaceful round
about, the Cricket sits and scrapes his fiddle.
</p>
<p>The inside of the house is devoid of luxury, with bare and yet not coarse walls. Ample
leisure allows the inhabitant to do away with any unpleasant roughness. At the <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>end of the passage is the bedroom, the terminal alcove, a little more carefully smoothed
than the rest and slightly wider. All said, it is a very simple abode, exceedingly
clean, free from damp and conforming with the requirements of a well-considered system
of hygiene. On the other hand, it is an enormous undertaking, a regular Cyclopean
tunnel, when we consider the modest means of excavation. Let us try to be present
at the work. Let us also enquire at what period the enterprise begins. This obliges
us to go back to the egg.
</p>
<p>Any one wishing to see the Cricket lay her eggs can do so without making great preparations:
all that he wants is a little patience, which, according to Buffon, is genius, but
which I, more modestly, will describe as the observer’s chief virtue. In April, or
at latest in May, we establish isolated couples of the insect in flower-pots containing
a layer of heaped-up earth. Their provisions consist of a lettuce-leaf renewed from
time to time. A square of glass covers the retreat and prevents escape.
</p>
<p>Some extremely interesting facts can be obtained with this simple installation, supplemented,
if need be, with a wire-gauze cover, <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>the best of all cages. We shall return to this matter. For the moment, let us watch
the laying and make sure that the propitious hour does not evade our vigilance.
</p>
<p>It is in the first week in June that my assiduous visits begin to show satisfactory
results. I surprise the mother standing motionless, with her ovipositor planted perpendicularly
in the soil. For a long time she remains stationed at the same point, heedless of
her indiscreet caller. At last she withdraws her dibble, removes, more or less perfunctorily,
the traces of the boring-hole, takes a moment’s rest, walks away and starts again
somewhere else, now here, now there, all over the area at her disposal. Her behaviour,
though her movements are slower, is a repetition of what the Decticus has shown us.
Her egg-laying appears to me to be ended within the twenty-four hours. For greater
certainty, I wait a couple of days longer.
</p>
<p>I then dig up the earth in the pot. The straw-coloured eggs are cylinders rounded
at both ends and measuring about one-ninth of an inch in length. They are placed singly
in the soil, arranged vertically and grouped in more or less numerous patches, which
correspond <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>with the successive layings. I find them all over the pot, at a depth of three-quarters
of an inch. There are difficulties in examining a mass of earth through a magnifying-glass;
but, allowing for these difficulties, I estimate the eggs laid by one mother at five
or six hundred. So large a family is sure to undergo a drastic purging before long.
</p>
<p>The Cricket’s egg is a little marvel of mechanism. After hatching, it appears as an
opaque white sheath, with a round and very regular aperture at the top; to the edge
of this a cap adheres, forming a lid. Instead of bursting anyhow under the thrusts
or cuts of the new-born larva, it opens of its own accord along a specially prepared
line of least resistance.
</p>
<p>It became important to observe the curious hatching. About a fortnight after the egg
is laid, two large, round, rusty-black eye-dots darken the front end. A little way
above these two dots, right at the apex of the cylinder, you see the outline of a
thin circular swelling. This is the line of rupture which is preparing. Soon the translucency
of the egg enables the observer to perceive the delicate segmentation of the tiny
creature <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>within. Now is the time to redouble our vigilance and multiply our visits, especially
in the morning.
</p>
<p>Fortune, which loves the persevering, rewards me for my assiduity. All round this
swelling where, by a process of infinite delicacy, the line of least resistance has
been prepared, the end of the egg, pushed back by the inmate’s forehead, becomes detached,
rises and falls to one side like the top of a miniature scent-bottle. The Cricket
pops out like a Jack-in-the-box.
</p>
<p>When he is gone, the shell remains distended, smooth, intact, pure white, with the
cap or lid hanging from the opening. A bird’s egg breaks clumsily under the blows
of a wart that grows for the purpose at the end of the chick’s beak; the Cricket’s
egg, endowed with a superior mechanism, opens like an ivory case. The thrust of the
inmate’s head is enough to work the hinge.
</p>
<p>The hatching of the eggs is hastened by the glorious weather; and the observer’s patience
is not much tried, the rapidity rivalling that of the Dung-beetles. The summer solstice
has not yet arrived when the ten couples interned under glass for the benefit of my
studies are surrounded by their <span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>numerous progeny. The egg-stage, therefore, lasts just about ten days.
</p>
<p>I said above that, when the lid of the ivory case is lifted, a young Cricket pops
out. This is not quite accurate. What appears at the opening is the swaddled grub,
as yet unrecognizable in a tight-fitting sheath. I expected to see this wrapper, this
first set of baby-clothes, for the same reasons that made me anticipate it in the
case of the Decticus:
</p>
<p>“The Cricket,” said I to myself, “is born underground. He also sports two very long
antennæ and a pair of overgrown hind-legs, all of which are cumbrous appendages at
the time of the emergence. He must therefore possess a tunic in which to make his
exit.”
</p>
<p>My forecast, correct enough in principle, was only partly confirmed. The new-born
Cricket does in fact possess a temporary structure; but, so far from employing it
for the purpose of hoisting himself outside, he throws off his clothes as he passes
out of the egg.
</p>
<p>To what circumstances are we to attribute this departure from the usual practice?
Perhaps to this: the Cricket’s egg stays in the ground for only a few days before
hatching; the egg of the Decticus remains there for <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>eight months. The former, save for rare exceptions in a season of drought, lies under
a thin layer of dry, loose, unresisting earth; the latter, on the contrary, finds
itself in soil which has been caked together by the persistent rains of autumn and
winter and which therefore presents serious difficulties. Moreover, the Cricket is
shorter and stouter, less long-shanked than the Decticus. These would appear to be
the reasons for the difference between the two insects in respect of their methods
of emerging. The Decticus, born lower down, under a close-packed layer, needs a climbing-costume
with which the Cricket is able to dispense, being less hampered and nearer to the
surface and having only a powdery layer of earth to pass through.
</p>
<p>Then what is the object of the tights which the Cricket flings aside as soon as he
is out of the egg? I will answer this question with another: what is the object of
the two white stumps, the two pale-coloured embryo wings carried by the Cricket under
his wing-cases, which are turned into a great mechanism of sound? They are so insignificant,
so feeble that the insect certainly makes no use of them, any more than the <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>Dog utilizes the thumb that hangs limp and lifeless at the back of his paw.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, for reasons of symmetry, the walls of a house are painted with imitation
windows to balance the other windows, which are real. This is done out of respect
for order, the supreme condition of the beautiful. In the same way, life has its symmetries,
its repetitions of a general prototype. When abolishing an organ that has ceased to
be employed, it leaves vestiges of it to maintain the primitive arrangement.
</p>
<p>The Dog’s rudimentary thumb predicates the five-fingered hand that characterizes the
higher animals; the Cricket’s wing-stumps are evidence that the insect would normally
be capable of flight; the moult undergone on the threshold of the egg is reminiscent
of the tight-fitting wrapper needed for the laborious exit of the Locustidæ born underground.
They are so many symmetrical superfluities, so many remains of a law that has fallen
into disuse but never been abrogated.
</p>
<p>As soon as he is deprived of his delicate tunic, the young Cricket, pale all over,
almost white, begins to battle with the soil overhead. He hits out with his mandibles;
he sweeps aside and kicks behind him the <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>powdery obstruction, which offers no resistance. Behold him on the surface, amidst
the joys of the sunlight and the perils of conflict with the living, poor, feeble
creature that he is, hardly larger than a Flea. In twenty-four hours he colours and
turns into a magnificent blackamoor, whose ebon hue vies with that of the adult insect.
All that remains of his original pallor is a white sash that girds his chest and reminds
us of a baby’s leading-string. Very nimble and alert, he sounds the surrounding space
with his long, quivering antennæ, runs about and jumps with an impetuosity in which
his future obesity will forbid him to indulge.
</p>
<p>This is also the age when the stomach is still delicate. What sort of food does he
need? I do not know. I offer him the adult’s treat, tender lettuce-leaves. He scorns
to touch them, or perhaps he takes mouthfuls so exceedingly small that they escape
me.
</p>
<p>In a few days, with my ten households, I find myself overwhelmed with family cares.
What am I to do with my five or six thousand Crickets, a pretty flock, no doubt, but
impossible to rear in my ignorance of the treatment required? I will <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>set you at liberty, my little dears; I will entrust you to nature, the sovran nurse.
</p>
<p>Thus it comes to pass. I release my legions in the enclosure, here, there and everywhere,
in the best places. What a concert I shall have outside my door next year, if they
all turn out well! But no, the symphony will probably be one of silence, for the savage
pruning due to the mother’s fertility is bound to come. All that I can hope for is
that a few couples may survive extermination.
</p>
<p>As in the case of the young Praying Mantes, the first that hasten to this manna and
the most eager for the slaughter are the little Grey Lizard and the Ant. The latter,
loathsome freebooter that she is, will, I fear, not leave me a single Cricket in the
garden. She snaps up the poor little creatures, eviscerates them and gobbles them
down at frantic speed.
</p>
<p>Oh, the execrable wretch! And to think that we place the Ant in the front rank of
insects! Books are written in her honour and the stream of eulogy never ceases; the
naturalists hold her in the greatest esteem and add daily to her reputation, so true
is it, among animals as among men, that of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>various ways of making history, the surest way is to do harm to others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3539src" href="#xd31e3539">6</a>
</p>
<p>Nobody asks after the Dung-beetle and the Necrophorus,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3547src" href="#xd31e3547">7</a> invaluable scavengers both, whereas everybody knows the Gnat, that drinker of men’s
blood; the Wasp, that hot-tempered swashbuckler, with her poisoned dagger; and the
Ant, that notorious evil-doer, who, in our southern villages, saps and imperils the
rafters of a dwelling with the same zest with which she devours a fig. I need not
trouble to say more: every one will discover in the records of mankind similar instances
of usefulness ignored and frightfulness exalted.
</p>
<p>The massacre instituted by the Ants and other exterminators is so great that my erstwhile
populous colonies in the enclosure become too small to enable me to continue my observations;
and I am driven to have recourse to information outside. In August, among the fallen
leaves, in those little oases where the grass has not been wholly scorched by the
sun, I find the young Cricket already rather big, black all over like the adult, <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>with not a vestige of the white girdle of his early days. He has no domicile. The
shelter of a dead leaf, the cover of a flat stone are enough for him; they represent
the tents of a nomad who cares not where he lays his head.
</p>
<p>This vagabond life continues until the middle of autumn. It is then that the Yellow-winged
Sphex<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3557src" href="#xd31e3557">8</a> hunts down the wanderers, an easy prey, and stores her bag of Crickets underground.
She decimates those who have survived the Ants’ devastating raids. A settled dwelling,
dug a few weeks before the usual time, would save them from the spoilers. The sorely-tried
victims do not think of it. The bitter experience of the centuries has taught them
nothing. Though already strong enough to dig a protecting burrow, they remain invincibly
faithful to their ancient customs and would go on roaming though the Sphex stabbed
the last of their race.
</p>
<p>It is at the close of October, when the first cold weather threatens, that the burrow
is taken in hand. The work is very simple, judging by the little that my observation
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>the caged insect has shown me. The digging is never done at a bare point in the pan,
but always under the shelter of a withered lettuce-leaf, some remnant of the food
provided. This takes the place of the grass screen that seems indispensable to the
secrecy of the establishment.
</p>
<p>The miner scrapes with his fore-legs and uses the pincers of his mandibles to extract
the larger bits of gravel. I see him stamping with his powerful hind-legs, furnished
with a double row of spikes; I see him raking the rubbish, sweeping it backwards and
spreading it slantwise. There you have the method in its entirety.
</p>
<p>The work proceeds pretty quickly at first. In the yielding soil of my cages, the digger
disappears underground after a spell that lasts a couple of hours. He returns to the
entrance at intervals, always backwards and always sweeping. Should he be overcome
with fatigue, he takes a rest on the threshold of his half-finished home, with his
head outside and his antennæ waving feebly. He goes in again and resumes work with
pincers and rakes. Soon the periods of repose become longer and wear out my patience.
</p>
<p>The most urgent part of the work is done. <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>Once the hole is a couple of inches deep, it suffices for the needs of the moment.
The rest will be a long-winded business, resumed in a leisurely fashion, a little
one day and a little the next; the hole will be made deeper and wider as demanded
by the inclemencies of the weather and the growth of the insect. Even in winter, if
the temperature be mild and the sun playing over the entrance to the dwelling, it
is not unusual to see the Cricket shooting out rubbish, a sign of repairs and fresh
excavations. Amidst the joys of spring, the upkeep of the building still continues.
It is constantly undergoing improvements and repairs until the owner’s decease.
</p>
<p>April comes to an end and the Cricket’s song begins, at first in rare and shy solos,
soon developing into a general symphony in which each clod of turf boasts its performer.
I am more than inclined to place the Cricket at the head of the spring choristers.
In our waste lands, when the thyme and the lavender are gaily flowering, he has as
his partner the Crested Lark, who rises like a lyrical rocket, his throat swelling
with notes, and from the sky, invisible in the clouds, sheds his sweet music upon
the fallows. Down below the Crickets chant the responses. Their <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>song is monotonous and artless, but so well-suited, in its very crudity, to the rustic
gladness of renascent life! It is the hosanna of the awakening, the sacred alleluia
understood by swelling seed and sprouting blade. Who deserves the palm in this duet?
I should award it to the Cricket. He surpasses them all, thanks to his numbers and
his unceasing note. Were the Lark to fall silent, the fields blue-grey with lavender,
swinging its fragrant censers before the sun, would still receive from this humble
chorister a solemn celebration.

<h2 class="main">THE CRICKET: THE SONG; THE PAIRING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In steps anatomy and says to the Cricket, bluntly:
</p>
<p>“Show us your musical-box.”
</p>
<p>Like all things of real value, it is very simple; it is based on the same principle
as that of the Grasshoppers: a bow with a hook to it and a vibrating membrane. The
right wing-case overlaps the left and covers it almost completely, except where it
folds back sharply and encases the insect’s side. It is the converse of what we see
in the Green Grasshopper, the Decticus, the Ephippiger and their kinsmen. The Cricket
is right-handed, the others left-handed.
</p>
<p>The two wing-cases have exactly the same structure. To know one is to know the other.
Let us describe the one on the right. It is almost flat on the back and slants suddenly
at the side in a right-angled fold, encircling the abdomen with a pinion which <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>has delicate, parallel veins running in an oblique direction. The dorsal surface has
stronger and more prominent nervures, of a deep-black colour, which, taken together,
form a strange, complicated design, bearing some resemblance to the hieroglyphics
of an Arabic manuscript.
</p>
<p>By holding it up to the light, one can see that it is a very pale red, save for two
large adjoining spaces, a larger, triangular one in front and a smaller, oval one
at the back. Each is framed in a prominent nervure and scored with faint wrinkles.
The first, moreover, is strengthened with four or five chevrons; the second with only
one, which is bow-shaped. These two areas represent the Grasshoppers’ mirror; they
constitute the sounding-areas. The skin is finer here than elsewhere and transparent,
though of a somewhat smoky tint.
</p>
<p>The front part, which is smooth and slightly red in hue, is bounded at the back by
two curved, parallel veins, having between them a cavity containing a row of five
or six little black wrinkles that look like the rungs of a tiny ladder. The left wing-case
presents an exact duplicate of the right. The wrinkles constitute the friction-nervures
<span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>which intensify the vibration by increasing the number of the points that are touched
by the bow.
</p>
<p>On the lower surface, one of the two veins that surround the cavity with the rungs
becomes a rib cut into the shape of a hook. This is the bow. I count in it about a
hundred and fifty triangular teeth or prisms of exquisite geometrical perfection.
</p>
<p>It is a fine instrument indeed, far superior to that of the Decticus. The hundred
and fifty prisms of the bow, biting into the rungs of the opposite wing-case, set
the four drums in motion at one and the same time, the lower pair by direct friction,
the upper pair by the shaking of the friction-apparatus. What a rush of sound! The
Decticus, endowed with a single paltry mirror, can be heard just a few steps away;
the Cricket, possessing four vibratory areas, throws his ditty to a distance of some
hundreds of yards.
</p>
<p>He vies with the Cicada in shrillness, without having the latter’s disagreeable harshness.
Better still: this favoured one knows how to modulate his song. The wing-cases, as
we said, extend over either side in a wide fold. These are the dampers <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>which, lowered to a greater or lesser depth, alter the intensity of the sound and,
according to the extent of their contact with the soft abdomen, allow the insect to
sing <i lang="it">mezza voce</i> at one time and <i lang="it">fortissimo</i> at another.
</p>
<p>The exact similarity of the two wing-cases is worthy of attention. I can see clearly
the function of the upper bow and the four sounding-areas which it sets in motion;
but what is the good of the lower one, the bow on the left wing? Not resting on anything,
it has nothing to strike with its hook, which is as carefully toothed as the other.
It is absolutely useless, unless the apparatus can invert the order of its two parts
and place that above which was below. After such an inversion, the perfect symmetry
of the instrument would cause the necessary mechanism to be reproduced in every respect
and the insect would be able to stridulate with the hook which is at present unemployed.
It would scrape away as usual with its lower fiddlestick, now become the upper; and
the tune would remain the same.
</p>
<p>Is this permutation within its power? Can the insect use both pot-hooks, changing
from one to the other when it grows tired, <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>which would mean that it could keep up its music all the longer? Or are there at least
some Crickets who are permanently left-handed? I expected to find this the case, because
of the absolute symmetry of the wing-cases. Observation convinced me of the contrary.
I have never come across a Cricket that failed to conform with the general rule. All
those whom I have examined—and they are many—without a single exception carried the
right wing-case above the left.
</p>
<p>Let us try to interfere and to bring about by artifice what natural conditions refuse
to show us. Using my forceps, very gently, of course, and without straining the wing-cases,
I make these overlap the opposite way. This result is easily obtained with a little
dexterity and patience. The thing is done. Everything is in order. There is no dislocation
at the shoulders; the membranes are without a crease. Things could not be better-arranged
under normal conditions.
</p>
<p>Was the Cricket going to sing, with his inverted instrument? I was almost expecting
it, appearances were so much in its favour; but I was soon undeceived. The insect
submits for a few moments; then, finding <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>the inversion uncomfortable, it makes an effort and restores the instrument to its
regular position. In vain I repeat the operation: the Cricket’s obstinacy triumphs
over mine. The displaced wing-cases always resume their normal arrangement. There
is nothing to be done in this direction.
</p>
<p>Shall I be more successful if I make my attempt while the wing-cases are still immature?
At the actual moment, they are stiff membranes, resisting any changes. The fold is
already there; it is at the outset that the material should be manipulated. What shall
we learn from organs that are quite new and still plastic, if we invert them as soon
as they appear? The thing is worth trying.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, I go to the larva and watch for the moment of its metamorphosis,
a sort of second birth. The future wings and wing-cases form four tiny flaps which,
by their shape and their scantiness, as well as by the way in which they stick out
in different directions, remind me of the short jackets worn by the Auvergne cheese-makers.
I am most assiduous in my attendance, lest I should miss the propitious moment, and
at last have a chance to witness the moulting. <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>In the early part of May, at about eleven in the morning, a larva casts off its rustic
garments before my eyes. The transformed Cricket is now a reddish brown, all but the
wings and wing-cases, which are beautifully white.
</p>
<p>Both wings and wing-cases, which only issued from their sheaths quite recently, are
no more than short, crinkly stumps. The former remain in this rudimentary state, or
nearly so. The latter gradually develop bit by bit and open out; their inner edges,
with a movement too slow to be perceived, meet one another, on the same plane and
at the same level. There is no sign to tell us which of the two wing-cases will overlap
the other. The two edges are now touching. A few moments longer and the right will
be above the left. This is the time to intervene.
</p>
<p>With a straw I gently change the position, bringing the left edge over the right.
The insect protests a little and disturbs my manœuvring. I insist, while taking every
possible care not to endanger these tender organs, which look as though they were
cut out of wet tissue-paper. And I am quite successful: the left wing-case pushes
forward above the right, but only very little, barely <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>a twenty-fifth of an inch. We will leave it alone: things will now go of themselves.
</p>
<p>They go as well as one could wish, in fact. Continuing to spread, the left wing-case
ends by entirely covering the other. At three o’clock in the afternoon, the Cricket
has changed from a reddish hue to black, but the wing-cases are still white. Two hours
more and they also will possess the normal colouring.
</p>
<p>It is over. The wing-cases have come to maturity under the artificial arrangement;
they have opened out and moulded themselves according to my plans; they have taken
breadth and consistency and have been born, so to speak, in an inverted position.
As things now are, the Cricket is left-handed. Will he definitely remain so? It seems
to me that he will; and my hopes rise higher on the morrow and the day after, for
the wing-cases continue, without any trouble, in their unusual arrangement. I expect
soon to see the artist wield that particular fiddlestick which the members of his
family never employ. I redouble my watchfulness, so as to witness his first attempt
at playing the violin.
</p>
<p>On the third day, the novice makes a <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>start. A few brief grating sounds are heard, the noise of a machine out of gear shifting
its parts back into their proper order. Then the song begins, with its accustomed
tone and rhythm.
</p>
<p>Veil your face, O foolish experimenter, overconfident in your mischievous straw! You
thought that you had created a new type of instrumentalist; and you have obtained
nothing at all. The Cricket has thwarted your schemes: he is scraping with his right
fiddlestick and always will. With a painful effort, he has dislocated his shoulders,
which were made to mature and harden the wrong way; and, in spite of a set that seemed
definite, he has put back on top that which ought to be on top and underneath that
which ought to be underneath. Your sorry science tried to make a left-handed player
of him. He laughs at your devices and settles down to be right-handed for the rest
of his life.
</p>
<p>Franklin left an eloquent plea on behalf of the left hand, which, he considered, deserved
as careful training as its fellow. What an immense advantage it would be thus to have
two servants each as capable as the other! Yes, certainly; but, except for <span class="pageNum" id="pb336">[<a href="#pb336">336</a>]</span>a few rare instances, is this equality of strength and skill in the two hands possible?
</p>
<p>The Cricket answers no: there is an original weakness in the left side, a want of
balance, which habit and training can to a certain extent correct, but which they
can never cause wholly to disappear. Though shaped by a training which takes it at
its birth and moulds and solidifies it on the top of the other, the left wing-case
none the less resumes the lower position when the insect tries to sing. As to the
cause of this original inferiority, that is a problem which belongs to embryogenesis.
</p>
<p>My failure confirms the fact that the left wing-case is unable to make use of its
bow, even when supplemented by the aid of art. Then what is the object of that hook
whose exquisite precision yields in no respect to that of the other? We might appeal
to reasons of symmetry and talk about the repetition of an archetypal design, as I,
for want of a better argument, did just now in the matter of the cast raiment which
the young Cricket leaves on the threshold of his ovular sheath; but I prefer to confess
that this would be but the semblance of an explanation, wrapped up in specious language.
For the Decticus, <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>the Grasshopper and the other Locustidæ would come and show us their wing-cases, one
with the bow only, the other with the mirror, and say:
</p>
<p>“Why should the Cricket, our near kinsman, be symmetrical, whereas all of us Locustidæ,
without exception, are asymmetrical?”
</p>
<p>There is no valid answer to their objection. Let us confess our ignorance and humbly
say:
</p>
<p>“I do not know.”
</p>
<p>It wants but a Midge’s wing to confound our proudest theories.
</p>
<p>Enough of the instrument; let us listen to the music. The Cricket sings on the threshold
of his house, in the cheerful sunshine, never indoors. The wing-cases, lifted in a
double inclined plane and now only partly covering each other, utter their stridulant
<i>cri-cri</i> in a soft tremolo. It is full, sonorous, nicely cadenced and lasts indefinitely.
Thus are the leisures of solitude beguiled all through the spring. The anchorite at
first sings for his own pleasure. Glad to be alive, he chants the praises of the sun
that shines upon him, the grass that feeds him, the peaceful retreat that harbours
him. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>first object of his bow is to hymn the blessings of life.
</p>
<p>The hermit also sings for the benefit of his fair neighbours. The Cricket’s nuptials
would, I warrant, present a curious scene, if it were possible to follow their details
far from the commotions of captivity. To seek an opportunity would be labour lost,
for the insect is very shy. I must await one. Shall I ever find it? I do not despair,
in spite of the extraordinary difficulty. For the moment, let us be satisfied with
what we can learn from probability and the vivarium.
</p>
<p>The two sexes dwell apart. Both are extremely domestic in their habits. Whose business
is it to make a move? Does the caller go in search of the called? Does the serenaded
one come to the serenader? If, at pairing-time, sound were the sole guide where homes
are far apart, it would be necessary for the silent partner to go to the noisy one’s
trysting-place. But I imagine that, in order to save appearances—and this accords
with what I learn from my prisoners—the Cricket has special faculties that guide him
towards his mute lady-love.
</p>
<p>When and how is the meeting effected? I suspect that things take place in the friendly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>gloaming and upon the very threshold of the bride’s home, upon that sanded esplanade,
that state courtyard, which lies just outside the entrance.
</p>
<p>A nocturnal journey like this, at some twenty paces’ distance, is a serious undertaking
for the Cricket. When he has accomplished his pilgrimage, how will he, the stay-at-home,
with his imperfect knowledge of topography, find his own house again? To return to
his Penates must be impossible. He roams, I fear, at random, with no place to lay
his head. He has neither the time nor the heart to dig himself the new burrow which
would be his salvation; and he dies a wretched death, forming a savoury mouthful for
the Toad on his night rounds. His visit to the lady Cricket has cost him his home
and his life. What does he care! He has done his duty as a Cricket.
</p>
<p>This is how I picture events when I combine the probabilities of the open country
with the realities of the vivarium. I have several couples in one cage. As a rule,
my captives refrain from digging themselves a dwelling. The hour has passed for any
long waiting or long wooing. They wander about the enclosed space, without troubling
about <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>a fixed home, or else lie low under the shelter of a lettuce-leaf.
</p>
<p>Peace reigns in the household until the quarrelsome instincts of pairing-time break
out. Then affrays between suitors are frequent and lively, though not serious. The
two rivals stand face to face, bite each other in the head, that solid, fang-proof
helmet, roll each other over, pick themselves up and separate. The vanquished Cricket
makes off as fast as he can; the victor insults him with a boastful ditty; then, moderating
his tone, he veers and tacks around the object of his desires.
</p>
<p>He makes himself look smart and, at the same time, submissive. Gripping one of his
antennæ with a claw, he takes it in his mandibles to curl it and grease it with saliva.
With his long spurred and red-striped hind-legs, he stamps the ground impatiently
and kicks out at nothing. His emotion renders him dumb. His wing-cases, it is true,
quiver rapidly, but they give forth no sound, or at most an agitated rustling.
</p>
<p>A vain declaration! The female Cricket runs and hides herself in a curly bit of lettuce.
She lifts the curtain a little, however, and looks out and wishes to be seen.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Et fugit ad salices; et se cupit ante videri</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3677src" href="#xd31e3677">1</a> </p>
</div>
<p class="first">said the delightful eclogue, two thousand years ago. Thrice-consecrated strategy of
love, thou art everywhere the same!
</p>
<p>The song is resumed, intersected by silences and murmuring quavers. Touched by so
much passion, Galatea, I mean Dame Cricket, issues from her hiding-place. The other
goes up to her, suddenly spins round, turns his back to her and flattens his abdomen
against the ground. Crawling backwards, he makes repeated efforts to slip underneath.
The curious backward manœuvre at last succeeds. Gently, my little one, gently! Discreetly
flattened out, you manage to slide under. That’s done it! We have our couple. A spermatophore,
a granule smaller than a pin’s head, hangs where it ought to. The meadows will have
their Crickets next year.
</p>
<p>The laying of the eggs follows soon after. Then this cohabitation in couples in a
cage often brings about domestic quarrels. The father is knocked about and crippled;
his <span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>violin is smashed to bits. Outside my cells, in the open fields, the hen-pecked husband
is able to take to flight; and that indeed is what he appears to do, not without good
reason.
</p>
<p>This ferocious aversion of the mother for the father, even among the most peaceable,
gives food for thought. The sweetheart of but now, if he come within reach of the
lady’s teeth, is eaten more or less; he does not escape from the final interviews
without leaving a leg or two and some shreds of wing-cases behind him. Locusts and
Crickets, those lingering representatives of a bygone world, tell us that the male,
a mere secondary wheel in life’s original mechanism, has to disappear at short notice
and make room for the real propagator, the real worker, the mother.
</p>
<p>Later, in the higher order of creation, sometimes even among insects, he is awarded
a task as a collaborator; and nothing better could be desired: the family must needs
gain by it. But the Cricket, faithful to the old traditions, has not yet got so far.
Therefore the object of yesterday’s longing becomes to-day an object of hatred, ill-treated,
disembowelled and eaten up.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>Even when free to escape from his pugnacious mate, the superannuated Cricket soon
perishes, a victim to life. In June, all my captives succumb, some dying a natural,
others a violent death. The mothers survive for some time in the midst of their newly-hatched
family. But things happen differently when the males have the advantage of remaining
bachelors: they then enjoy a remarkable longevity. Let me relate the facts.
</p>
<p>We are told that the music-loving Greeks used to keep Cicadæ in cages, the better
to enjoy their singing. I venture to disbelieve the whole story. In the first place,
the harsh clicking of the Cicadæ, when long continued at close quarters, is a torture
to ears that are at all delicate. The Greeks’ sense of hearing was too well-disciplined
to take pleasure in such raucous sounds away from the general concert of the fields,
which is heard at a distance.
</p>
<p>In the second place, it is absolutely impossible to bring up Cicadæ in captivity,
unless we cover over an olive-tree or a plane-tree, which would supply us with a vivarium
very difficult to instal on a window-sill. A single day spent in a cramped enclosure
<span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>would make the high-flying insect die of boredom.
</p>
<p>Is it not possible that people have confused the Cricket with the Cicada, as they
also do the Green Grasshopper? With the Cricket they would be quite right. He is one
who bears captivity gaily: his stay-at-home ways predispose him to it. He lives happily
and whirrs without ceasing in a cage no larger than a man’s fist, provided that we
serve him with his lettuce-leaf every day. Was it not he whom the small boys of Athens
reared in little wire cages hanging on a window-frame?
</p>
<p>Their successors in Provence and all over the south have the same tastes. In the towns,
a Cricket becomes the child’s treasured possession. The insect, petted and pampered,
tells him in its ditty of the simple joys of the country. Its death throws the whole
household into a sort of mourning.
</p>
<p>Well, these recluses, these compulsory celibates, live to be patriarchs. They keep
fit and well long after their cronies in the fields have succumbed; and they go on
singing till September. Those additional three months, a long space of time, double
their existence in the adult form.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>The cause of this longevity is obvious. Nothing wears one out so quickly as life.
The wild Crickets have gaily spent their reserves of energy on the ladies; the more
fervent their ardour, the speedier their dissolution. The others, their incarcerated
kinsmen, leading a very quiet life, have acquired a further period of existence by
reason of their forced abstinence from too costly joys. Having neglected to perform
the superlative duty of a Cricket, they obstinately refuse to die until the very last
moment.
</p>
<p>A brief study of the three other Crickets of my neighbourhood has taught me nothing
of any interest. Possessing no fixed abode, no burrow, they wander about from one
temporary shelter to another, under the dry grass or in the cracks of the clods. They
all carry the same musical instrument as the Field Cricket, with slight variations
of detail. Their song is much alike in all cases, allowing for differences of size.
The smallest of the family, the Bordeaux Cricket, stridulates outside my door, under
the cover of the box borders. He even ventures into the dark corners of the kitchen,
but his song is so faint that it takes a very attentive ear <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>to hear it and to discover at last where the insect lies hidden.
</p>
<p>In our part of the world, we do not have the House Cricket, that denizen of bakers’
shops and rural fireplaces. But, though the crevices under the hearthstones in my
village are silent, the summer nights make amends by filling the country-side with
a charming symphony unknown in the north. Spring, during its sunniest hours, has the
Field Cricket as its musician; the calm summer nights have the Italian Cricket (<i lang="la">Œcanthus pellucens</i>, <span class="sc">Scop.</span>). One diurnal, the other nocturnal, they share the fine weather between them. By
the time that the first has ceased to sing, it is not long before the other begins
his serenade.
</p>
<p>The Italian Cricket has not the black dress and the clumsy shape characteristic of
the family. He is, on the contrary, a slender, fragile insect, quite pale, almost
white, as beseems his nocturnal habits. You are afraid of crushing him, if you merely
take him in your fingers. He leads an aerial existence on shrubs of every kind, or
on the taller grasses; and he rarely descends to earth. His song, the sweet music
of the still, hot evenings from July to October, begins at <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>sunset and continues for the best part of the night.
</p>
<p>This song is known to everybody here, for the smallest clump of bushes has its orchestra.
It is heard even in the granaries, into which the insect sometimes strays, attracted
by the fodder. But the pale Cricket’s ways are so mysterious that nobody knows exactly
the source of the serenade, which is very erroneously ascribed to the Common Black
Cricket, who at this period is quite young and silent.
</p>
<p>The song is a soft, slow <i>gri-i-i, gri-i-i</i>, which is rendered more expressive by a slight tremolo. On hearing it, we divine
both the extreme delicacy and the size of the vibrating membranes. If nothing happen
to disturb the insect, settled in the lower leaves, the sound remains unaltered; but,
at the least noise, the executant becomes a ventriloquist. You heard him here, quite
close, in front of you; and now, all of a sudden, you hear him over there, fifteen
yards away, continuing his ditty softened by distance.
</p>
<p>You move across. Nothing. The sound comes from the original place. No, it doesn’t,
after all. This time, it is coming from over there, on the left, or rather from <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>the right; or is it from behind? We are absolutely at a loss, quite unable to guide
ourselves by the ear towards the spot where the insect is chirping.
</p>
<p>It needs a fine stock of patience and the most minute precautions to capture the singer
by the light of a lantern. The few specimens caught under these conditions and caged
have supplied me with the little that I know about the musician who is so clever at
baffling our ears.
</p>
<p>The wing-cases are both formed of a broad, dry, diaphanous membrane, fine as a white
onion-skin and capable of vibrating throughout its whole area. They are shaped like
a segment of a circle thinning towards the upper end. This segment folds back at right
angles along a prominent longitudinal vein and forms a flap which encloses the insect’s
side when at rest.
</p>
<p>The right wing-case lies above the left. Its inner edge bears underneath, near the
root, a knob which is the starting-point of five radiating veins, of which two run
upwards, two downwards and the fifth almost transversely. The last-named, which is
slightly reddish, is the main part, in short the bow, as is shown by the fine notches
cut <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>across it. The rest of the wing-case presents a few other veins of minor importance,
which keep the membrane taut without forming part of the friction-apparatus.
</p>
<p>The left or lower wing-case is similarly constructed, with this difference that the
bow, the knob and the veins radiating from it now occupy the upper surface. We find,
moreover, that the two bows, the right and the left, cross each other obliquely.
</p>
<p>When the song has its full volume, the wing-cases, raised high up and resembling a
pair of large gauze sails, touch only at their inner edges. Then the two bows fit
into each other slantwise and their mutual friction produces the sonorous vibration
of the two stretched membranes.
</p>
<p>The sound appears to be modified according as the strokes of each bow bear upon the
knob, which is itself wrinkled, on the opposite wing-case, or upon one of the four
smooth radiating veins. This would go some way towards explaining the illusions produced
by music which seems to come from here, there and everywhere when the timid insect
becomes distrustful.
</p>
<p>The illusion of loud or soft, open or muffled sounds and consequently of distance,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>which forms the chief resource of the ventriloquist’s art, has another, easily discovered
source. For the open sounds, the wing-cases are raised to their full height; for the
muffled sounds, they are lowered more or less. In the latter position, their outer
edges press to a varying extent upon the insect’s yielding sides, thus more or less
decreasing the vibratory surface and reducing the volume of sound.
</p>
<p>A gentle touch with one’s finger stifles the sound of a ringing wine-glass and changes
it into a veiled, indefinite note that seems to come from afar. The pale Cricket knows
this acoustic secret. He misleads those who are hunting for him by pressing the edges
of his vibrating flaps against his soft abdomen. Our musical instruments have their
dampers, their sourdines; that of <i lang="la">Œcanthus pellucens</i> vies with and surpasses them in the simplicity of its method and the perfection of
its results.
</p>
<p>The Field Cricket and his kinsmen also employ the sourdine by clasping their abdomen
higher or lower with the edge of their wing-cases; but none of them obtains from this
procedure such deceptive effects as those of the Italian Cricket.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>In addition to this illusion of distance, which, at the faintest sound of footsteps,
is constantly taking us by surprise, we have the purity of the note, with its soft
tremolo. I know no prettier or more limpid insect song, heard in the deep stillness
of an August evening. How often, <i lang="la">per amica silentia lunæ</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3771src" href="#xd31e3771">2</a> have I lain down on the ground, screened by the rosemary-bushes, to listen to the
delicious concert of the <i>harmas</i>!<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3790src" href="#xd31e3790">3</a>
</p>
<p>The nocturnal Cricket swarms in the enclosure. Every tuft of red-flowering rock-rose
has its chorister; so has every clump of lavender. The bushy arbutus-shrubs, the turpentine-trees,
all become orchestras. And, with its clear and charming voice, the whole of this little
world is sending questions and responses from shrub to shrub, or rather, indifferent
to the hymns of others, chanting its gladness for itself alone.
</p>
<p>High up, immediately above my head, the Swan stretches its great cross along <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>the Milky Way; below, all around me, the insects’ symphony rises and falls. The infinitesimal
telling its joys makes me forget the pageant of the stars. We know nothing of those
celestial eyes which look down upon us, placid and cold, with scintillations that
are like blinking eyelids. Science tells us of their distance, their speed, their
mass, their volume; it overwhelms us with enormous figures, stupefies us with immensities;
but it does not succeed in stirring a fibre within us. Why? Because it lacks the great
secret, that of life. What is there up there? What do those suns warm? Worlds like
ours, reason declares; planets whereon life revolves in infinite variety. It is a
superb conception of the universe, but, when all is said, only a conception, not supported
by obvious facts, those supreme proofs within the reach of all. The probable, the
extremely probable, is not the manifest, which forces itself upon us irresistibly
and leaves no room for doubt.
</p>
<p>In your company, on the contrary, O my Crickets, I feel the throbbing of life, which
is the soul of our lump of clay; and that is why, under my rosemary-hedge, I give
but an absent glance at the constellation of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>Swan and devote all my attention to your serenade! A dab of animated glair, capable
of pleasure and of pain, surpasses in interest the immensity of brute matter.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE LOCUSTS: THEIR FUNCTION; THEIR ORGAN OF SOUND</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Mind you are ready, children, to-morrow morning, before the sun gets too hot: we
are going Locust-hunting.”
</p>
<p>This announcement throws the household into great excitement at bed-time. What do
my little helpmates see in their dreams? Blue wings, red wings, suddenly flung out
fanwise; long, saw-toothed legs, pale-blue or pink, which kick out when we hold their
owners in our fingers; great shanks acting as springs that make the insect leap forward
like a projectile shot from some dwarf catapult hidden in the grass.
</p>
<p>What they behold in sleep’s sweet magic lantern I also happen to see. Life lulls us
with the same simple things in its first stages and its last.
</p>
<p>If there be one peaceful and safe form of hunting, one that comes within the powers
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>old age and childhood alike, it is Locust-hunting. Oh, what delicious mornings we
owe to it! What happy moments when the mulberries are black and allow my assistants
to go pilfering here and there in the bushes! What memorable excursions on the slopes
covered with sparse grass, tough and burnt yellow by the sun! I retain a vivid recollection
of all this; and my children will do the same.
</p>
<p>Little Paul has nimble legs, a ready hand and a piercing eye. He inspects the clumps
of everlastings where the Tryxalis solemnly nods his sugar-loaf head; he scrutinizes
the bushes out of which the big Grey Locust suddenly flies like a little bird surprised
by the hunter. Great disappointment on the part of the latter, who, after first rushing
off at full speed, stops and gazes in wonder at this mock Swallow flying far away.
He will have better luck another time. We shall not go home without a few of those
magnificent prizes.
</p>
<p>Younger than her brother, Marie Pauline patiently watches for the Italian Locust,
with his pink wings and carmine hind-legs; but she really prefers another jumper,
the most elegantly attired of all. Her favourite wears <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>a St. Andrew’s cross on the small of his back, which is marked by four white, slanting
stripes. His livery has patches of verdigris, the exact colour of the patina on old
bronze medals. With her hand raised in the air, ready to swoop down, she approaches
very softly, stooping low. Whoosh! That’s done it! Quick, a screw of paper to receive
the treasure, which, thrust head first into the opening, plunges with one bound to
the bottom of the funnel.
</p>
<p>Thus are our bags distended one by one; thus are our boxes filled. Before the heat
becomes too great to bear, we are in possession of a number of varied specimens which,
raised in captivity, will perhaps teach us something, if we know how to question them.
Thereupon we go home again. The Locust has made three people happy at a small cost.
</p>
<p>The first question that I put to my boarders is this:
</p>
<p>“What function do you perform in the fields?”
</p>
<p>You have a bad reputation, I know; the text-books describe you as noxious. Do you
deserve this reproach? I take the liberty of doubting it, except, of course, in the
case of <span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>the terrible ravagers who form the scourge of Africa and the east.
</p>
<p>The ill repute of those voracious eaters has left its mark on you all, though I look
upon you as much more useful than injurious. Never, so far as I know, have our peasants
complained of you. What damage could they lay to your charge?
</p>
<p>You nibble the tops of the tough grasses which the Sheep refuses to touch; you prefer
the lean swards to the fat pastures; you browse on sterile land where none but you
would find the wherewithal to feed himself; you live upon what could never be used
without the aid of your healthy stomach.
</p>
<p>Besides, by the time that you frequent the fields, the only thing that might tempt
you, the green wheat, has long since yielded its grain and disappeared. If you happen
to get into the kitchen-gardens and levy toll on them to some slight extent, it is
not a rank offence. A man can console himself for a piece bitten out of a leaf or
two of salad.
</p>
<p>To measure the importance of things by the foot-rule of one’s own turnip-patch is
a horrible method, which makes us forget the essential for the sake of a trivial detail.
The short-sighted man would upset the order of <span class="pageNum" id="pb358">[<a href="#pb358">358</a>]</span>the universe rather than sacrifice a dozen plums. If he thinks of the insect at all,
it is only to speak of its extermination.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is not and never will be in his power. Look at the consequences,
for instance, of the disappearance of the Locust, who is accused of stealing a few
crumbs from earth’s rich table. In September and October, the Turkeys are driven into
the stubble-fields, under the charge of a child armed with two long reeds. The expanse
over which the gobbling flock slowly spreads is bare, dry and burnt by the sun. At
the most, a few ragged thistles raise their belated heads. What do the birds do in
a desert like this, simply reeking with famine? They cram themselves, in order to
do honour to the Christmas table; they wax fat; their flesh becomes firm and appetizing.
With what, pray? With Locusts, whom they snap up here and there, a delicious stuffing
for their greedy crops. This autumnal manna, which costs nothing and is richly flavoured,
contributes to the elaboration and the improvement of the succulent roast that will
be so largely eaten on the festive evening.
</p>
<p>When the Guinea-fowl, that domesticated game-bird, roams around the farm, uttering
<span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>her rasping note, what is it that she seeks? Seeds, no doubt, but, above all things,
Locusts, who puff her out under the wings with a pad of fat and give greater flavour
to her flesh.
</p>
<p>The Hen, much to our advantage, is just as fond of them. She well knows the virtues
of that dainty dish, which acts as a tonic and increases her laying-capacity. When
left at liberty, she hardly ever fails to lead her family to the stubble-fields, so
that they may learn how to snap up the exquisite mouthful deftly. In fact, all the
denizens of the poultry-yard, when free to wander about at will, owe to the Locust
a valuable addition to their diet.
</p>
<p>It becomes a much more important matter outside our domestic fowls. If you are a sportsman,
if you are able to appreciate the value of the Red-legged Partridge, the glory of
our southern hills, open the crop of the bird which you have just brought down. You
will see that it contains a splendid certificate to the services rendered by the much-maligned
insect. You will find it, nine times out of ten, more or less crammed with Locusts.
The Partridge dotes on them, prefers them to seed as long as he is able to <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>catch them. This highly-flavoured, substantial, stimulating fare would almost make
him forget the existence of seeds, if it were only there all the year round.
</p>
<p>Let us now consult the illustrious black-footed tribe, so warmly celebrated by Tousserel.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3850src" href="#xd31e3850">1</a> The head of the family is the Wheatear, the <i>Cul-blanc</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3856src" href="#xd31e3856">2</a> as the Provençal calls him, who grows disgracefully fat in September and supplies
delicious material for the skewer. At the time when I used to indulge in ornithological
expeditions, I made a practice of jotting down the contents of the birds’ crops and
gizzards, so as to become acquainted with their diet. Here is the Wheatear’s bill
of fare: Locusts, first of all; next, many various kinds of Beetles, such as Weevils,
Opatra, Chrysomelæ, or Golden-apple-beetles, Cassidæ, or Tortoise-beetles, and Harpali;
in the third place, Spiders, Iuli,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3864src" href="#xd31e3864">3</a> Woodlice and small Snails; lastly and <span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span>rarely, bramble-berries and the berries of the Cornelian cherry.
</p>
<p>As you see, there is a little of all kinds of small game, just as it comes. The insect-eater
does not turn his attention to berries except in the last resort, at seasons of dearth.
Out of forty-eight cases mentioned in my notes, vegetable food appears only three
times, in trifling proportions. The predominant item, both as regards frequency and
quantity, is the Locust, the smaller specimens being chosen, in order not to tax the
bird’s swallowing-powers.
</p>
<p>Even so with the other little birds of passage which, when autumn comes, call a halt
in Provence and prepare for the great pilgrimage by accumulating on their rumps a
travelling-allowance of fat. All of them feast on the Locust, that rich fare; all,
in the waste lands and fallows, gather as best they can the hopping tit-bit, that
source of vigour for flying. Locusts are the manna of little birds on their autumnal
journey.
</p>
<p>Nor does man himself scorn them. An Arab author quoted by General Daumas<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3875src" href="#xd31e3875">4</a> in his book, <i lang="fr">Le Grand désert</i>, tells us:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Grasshoppers<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3886src" href="#xd31e3886">5</a> are of good nourishment for men and Camels. Their claws, wings and head are taken
away and they are eaten fresh or dried, either roast or boiled and served with flesh,
flour and herbs.
</p>
<p>“When dried in the sun, they are ground to powder and mixed with milk or kneaded with
flour; and they are then cooked with fat or with butter and salt.
</p>
<p>“Camels eat them greedily and are given them dried or roast, heaped in a hollow between
two layers of charcoal. Thus also do the Nubians eat them.
</p>
<p>“When Miriam<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3894src" href="#xd31e3894">6</a> prayed God that she might eat flesh unpolluted by blood, God sent her Grasshoppers.
</p>
<p>“When the wives of the Prophet were sent Grasshoppers as a gift, they placed some
of these in baskets and sent them to other women.
</p>
<p>“Once, when the Caliph Omar was asked if it were lawful to eat Grasshoppers, he made
answer:
</p>
<p>“ ‘Would that I had a basket of them to eat!’
<span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Wherefore, from this testimony, it is very sure that, by the grace of God, Grasshoppers
were given to man for his nourishment.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Without going so far as the Arab naturalist, which would presuppose a power of digestion
not bestowed on every man, I feel entitled to say that the Locust is a gift of God
to a multitude of birds, as witness the long array of gizzards which I consulted.
</p>
<p>Many others, notably the reptile, hold him in esteem. I have found him in the belly
of the <i>Rassado</i>, that terror of the small girls of Provence, I mean the Eyed Lizard, who loves rocky
shelters turned into a furnace by a torrid sun. And I have often caught the little
Grey Lizard of the walls in the act of carrying off, in his tapering snout, the <i lang="la">spolia opima</i> of some long-awaited Acridian.
</p>
<p>Even fish revel in him, when good fortune brings him to them. The Locust’s leap has
no definite goal. A projectile discharged blindly, the insect comes down wherever
the unpremeditated release of its springs shoots it. If the place where it falls happen
to be the water, a fish is there at once to gobble up the dripping victim. It is sometimes
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>fatal dainty, for anglers use the Locust when they wish to bait their hook with a
particularly attractive morsel.
</p>
<p>Without expatiating further on the devourers of this small game, I can clearly see
the great usefulness of the Acridian who by successive leaps transmits to man, that
most wasteful of eaters, the lean grass now converted into exquisite fare. Gladly
therefore would I say, with the Arab writer:
</p>
<p>“Wherefore, from this testimony, it is very sure that, by the grace of God, Grasshoppers
were given to man for his nourishment.”
</p>
<p>One thing alone makes me hesitate: the direct consumption of the Locust. As regards
indirect consumption, under the form of Partridge, young Turkey and others, none will
think of denying him his praises. Is direct consumption then so unpleasant? That was
not the opinion of Omar,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3921src" href="#xd31e3921">7</a> the mighty caliph, the destroyer of the library of Alexandria. His stomach was as
rude as his intellect; and, by his own account, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>would have relished a basket of Grasshoppers.
</p>
<p>Long before him, others were content to eat them, though in this case it was a wise
frugality. Clad in his Camel’s-hair garment, St. John the Baptist, the bringer of
good tidings and the great stirrer of the populace in the days of Herod, lived in
the desert on Grasshoppers and wild honey:
</p>
<p>“And his meat was locusts and wild honey,” says the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
</p>
<p>Wild honey I know, if only from the pots of the Chalicodoma.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3931src" href="#xd31e3931">8</a> It is a very agreeable food. There remains the Grasshopper of the desert, otherwise
the Locust. In my youth, like every small boy, I appreciated a Grasshopper’s leg,
which I used to eat raw. It is not without flavour. To-day let us rise a peg higher
and try the fare of Omar and St. John the Baptist.
</p>
<p>I capture some fat Locusts and have them cooked in a very rough and ready fashion,
fried with butter and salt, as the Arab author prescribes. We all of us, big and little,
partake of the queer dish at dinner. <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>We pronounce favourably upon the caliph’s delicacy. It is far superior to the Cicadæ
extolled by Aristotle. It has a certain shrimpy flavour, a taste that reminds one
of grilled Crab; and, were it not that the shell is very tough for such slight edible
contents, I would go to the length of saying that it is good, without, however, feeling
any desire for more.
</p>
<p>My curiosity as a naturalist has now twice allowed itself to be tempted by the dishes
of antiquity: Cicadæ first; Locusts next. Neither the one nor the other roused my
enthusiasm. We must leave these things to the powerful jaws of the negroes and the
huge appetite of which the famous caliph gave proof.
</p>
<p>The queasiness of our stomachs, however, in no way decreases the Locusts’ merits.
Those little browsers of the burnt grass play a great part in the workshop where our
food is prepared. They swarm in vast legions which roam over the barren wastes, pecking
here and there, turning what could not otherwise be used into a foodstuff which is
passed on to a host of consumers, including, first and foremost, the bird that often
falls to man’s share.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pricked relentlessly by the needs of the stomach, the world knows no more imperative
duty than the acquisition of food. To secure a seat in the refectory, each animal
expends its sum total of activity, industry, toil, trickery and strife; and the general
banquet, which should be a joy, is to many a torment. Man is far from escaping the
miseries of the struggle for food. On the contrary, only too often he tastes them
in all their bitterness.
</p>
<p>Ingenious as he is, will he succeed in freeing himself from them? Science says yes.
Chemistry promises, in the near future, a solution of the problem of subsistence.
The sister science, physics, is preparing the way. Already it is contemplating how
to get more and better work done by the sun, that great sluggard who thinks that he
has done his duty by us when he sweetens our grapes and ripens our corn. It will bottle
his heat, garner his rays, in order to control them and employ them where we think
fit.
</p>
<p>With these supplies of energy, the hearths will blaze, the wheels will turn, the pestles
pound, the graters grate, the rollers grind; and the work of agriculture, so wasteful
at present, thwarted as it is by the inclemency <span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>of the seasons, will become factory-work, yielding economical and safe returns.
</p>
<p>Then chemistry will step in, with its legion of cunning reagents. It will turn everything
into nutritious matter, in a highly concentrated form, capable of being assimilated
in its entirety and leaving hardly any foul residue. A loaf of bread will be a pill;
a rumpsteak a drop of jelly. Of agricultural labour, the inferno of barbarian times,
nothing will remain but a memory, of interest only to the historians. The last Sheep
and the last Ox will figure, neatly stuffed, as curiosities in our museums, together
with the Mammoth dug up from the Siberian ice-fields.
</p>
<p>All that old lumber—herds and flocks, seeds, fruits and vegetables—is doomed to disappear
some day. Progress demands it, we are told; and the chemist’s retort, which, in its
presumptuous fashion, recognizes nothing as impossible, repeats the assertion.
</p>
<p>This golden age of foodstuffs leaves me very incredulous. When it is a question of
obtaining some new toxin, science displays alarming ingenuity. Our laboratory collections
are veritable arsenals of poisons. When the object is to invent a still in which <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>potatoes shall be made to yield torrents of alcohol capable of turning us into a nation
of sots, the resources of industry know no limits. But to procure by artificial means
a single mouthful of really nourishing matter is a very different business. Never
has any such product simmered in our retorts. The future, beyond a doubt, will do
no better. Organized matter, the only true food, escapes the formulæ of the laboratory.
Its chemist is life.
</p>
<p>We shall do well therefore to preserve agriculture and our herds. Let us leave our
nourishment to be prepared by the patient work of plants and animals, let us mistrust
the brutal factory and keep our confidence for more delicate methods and, in particular,
for the Locust’s stomach, which assists in the making of the Christmas Turkey. That
stomach has culinary receipts which the chemist’s retort will always envy without
succeeding in imitating them.
</p>
<p>This picker-up of nutritive trifles, destined to support a crowd of paupers, possesses
musical powers wherewith to express his joys. Consider a Locust at rest, blissfully
digesting his meal and enjoying the sunshine. With sharp strokes of the bow, <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>three or four times repeated and spaced with pauses, he sings his ditty. He scrapes
his sides with his great hind-legs, using now one, now the other, anon both at a time.
</p>
<p>The result is very poor, so slight indeed that I am obliged to have recourse to little
Paul’s ear in order to make sure that there is a sound at all. Such as it is, it resembles
the creaking of the point of a needle pushed across a sheet of paper. There you have
the whole song, so near akin to silence.
</p>
<p>There is nothing more to be expected from so rudimentary an instrument. We have nothing
here similar to what the Grasshopper clan have shown us: no toothed bow, no vibrating
membrane stretched into a drum. Let us, for instance, take a look at the Italian Locust
(<i lang="la">Caloptenus italicus</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), whose apparatus of sound is repeated in the other stridulating Acridians. His hinder
thighs are keel-shaped above and below. Each surface, moreover, has two powerful longitudinal
nervures. Between these main parts there is, in either case, a graduated row of smaller,
chevron-shaped nervures; and the whole thing is as prominent and as plainly marked
on this outer side as on the inner one. And what surprises me even <span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span>more than this similarity between the two surfaces is that all these nervures are
smooth. Lastly, the lower edge of the wing-cases, the edge rubbed by the thighs which
serve as a bow, also has nothing particular about it. We see, as indeed we do all
over the wing-cases, nervures that are powerful but devoid of any rasping roughness
or the least denticulation.
</p>
<p>What can this artless attempt at a musical instrument produce? Just as much as a dry
membrane will emit when you rub it. And for the sake of this trifle the insect lifts
and lowers its thighs, in sharp jerks, and is satisfied with the result. It rubs its
sides very much as we rub our hands together in sign of contentment, with no intention
of making a sound. That is its own particular way of expressing its joy in life.
</p>
<p>Examine it when the sky is partly obscured and the sun shines intermittently. There
comes a rift in the clouds. Forthwith the thighs begin to scrape, increasing their
activity as the sun grows hotter. The strains are very brief, but they are renewed
so long as the sunshine continues. The sky becomes overcast. Then and there the song
ceases, to be resumed with the next gleam of sunlight, <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>always in brief spasms. There is no mistaking it: here, in these fond lovers of the
light, we have a mere expression of happiness. The Locust has his moments of gaiety
when his crop is full and the sun benign.
</p>
<p>Not all the Acridians indulge in this joyous rubbing. The Tryxalis (<i lang="la">Truxalis nasuta</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), who sports a pair of immensely elongated hind-legs, maintains a gloomy silence
even under the most vigorous caresses of the sun. I have never seen him move his shanks
like a bow; he seems unable to use them—so long are they—for anything but hopping.
</p>
<p>Dumb likewise, apparently as a consequence of the excessive length of his hind-legs,
the big Grey Locust (<i lang="la">Pachytilus cinerescens</i>, <span class="sc">Fabr.</span>) has a peculiar way of diverting himself. The giant often visits me in the enclosure,
even in the depth of winter. In calm weather, when the sun is hot, I surprise him
in the rosemaries, with his wings unfurled and fluttering rapidly for a quarter of
an hour at a time, as though for flight. His twirling is so gentle, in spite of its
extreme speed, as to create hardly a perceptible rustle.
</p>
<p>Others still are much less well-endowed. <span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>One such is the Pedestrian Locust (<i lang="la">Pezotettix pedestris</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), the companion of the Alpine Analota on the ridges of the Ventoux. This foot-passenger
strolling amid the paronychias (<i lang="la">P. serpyllifola</i>) which lie spread in silvery expanses over the Alpine region; this short-jacketed
hopper, the guest of the androsaces (<i lang="la">A. villosa</i>), whose tiny flowers, white as the neighbouring snows, smile from out of their rosy
eyes, has the same fresh colouring as the plants around him. The sunlight, less veiled
in mists in the loftier regions, has made him a costume combining beauty and simplicity:
a pale-brown satin back; a yellow abdomen; big thighs coral-red below; hind-legs a
glorious azure-blue, with an ivory anklet in front. But, being incapable of going
beyond the larval form, this dandy remains short-coated.
</p>
<p>He has for wing-cases two wrinkled slips, distant one from the other and hardly covering
the first segment of the abdomen, and for wings two stumps that are even more abbreviated.
All this hardly covers his nakedness down to the waist. Any one seeing him for the
first time takes him for a larva and is wrong. It is indeed the adult insect, <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>ripe for mating; and the insect will remain in this undress to the end.
</p>
<p>Is it necessary to add that, with this skimpy jacket, stridulation is impossible?
The big hind-thighs are there, it is true; but what is lacking, for them to rub upon,
is the grating surface, the edge of the wing-cases. Whereas the other Locusts are
not to be described as noisy, this one is absolutely dumb. In vain have the most delicate
ears around me listened with might and main: there has never been the least sound
during the three months’ home breeding. This silent one must have other means of expressing
his joys and summoning his partner to the wedding. What are they? I do not know.
</p>
<p>Nor do I know why the insect deprives itself of wings and remains a plodding wayfarer,
when its near kinsmen, on the same Alpine swards, are excellently equipped for flight.
It possesses the germs of wing and wing-case, gifts which the egg gives to the larva;
and it does not think of using these germs by developing them. It persists in hopping,
with no further ambition; it is satisfied to go on foot, to remain a Pedestrian Locust,
as the nomenclators call it, when it <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>might, one would think, acquire wings, that higher mechanism of locomotion.
</p>
<p>Rapid flitting from crest to crest, over the valleys deep in snow; easy flight from
a shorn pasture to one not yet exploited: can these be negligible advantages to the
Pedestrian Locust? Obviously not. The other Acridians and in particular his fellow-dwellers
on the mountain-tops possess wings and are all the better for them. What is his reason
for not doing as they do? It would be very profitable to extract from their sheaths
the sails which he keeps packed away in useless stumps; and he does not do it. Why?
</p>
<p>“Arrested development,” says some one.
</p>
<p>Very well. Life is arrested half-way through its work; the insect does not attain
the ultimate form of which it bears the emblem. For all its scientific turn of phrase,
the reply is not really a reply at all. The question returns under another guise:
what causes that arrested development?
</p>
<p>The larva is born with the hope of flying at maturity. As a pledge of that fair future,
it carries on its back four sheaths in which the precious germs lie slumbering. Everything
is arranged according to the rules of <span class="pageNum" id="pb376">[<a href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>normal evolution. Thereupon, suddenly, the organism does not fulfil its promises;
it is false to its engagements; it leaves the adult insect without sails, leaves it
with only useless rags.
</p>
<p>Are we to lay this nudity to the charge of the harsh conditions of Alpine life? Not
at all, for the other hoppers, living on the same grassy slopes, manage very well
to achieve the wings foretold by the larva’s rudiments.
</p>
<p>Men tell us that, from one attempt to another, from progress to progress, under the
stimulus of necessity, animals end by acquiring this or that organ. No other creative
intervention is accepted than that of need. This, for instance, is the way in which
the Locusts went to work, in particular those whom I see fluttering over the ridges
of the Ventoux. From their niggardly larval flaps they are supposed to have extracted
wings and wing-cases, by virtue of secret and mysterious labours rendered fruitful
by the centuries.
</p>
<p>Very well, O my illustrious masters! And now tell me, if you please, what reasons
persuaded the Pedestrian Locust not to go beyond his rude outline of a flying-apparatus.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb377">[<a href="#pb377">377</a>]</span>He also, surely, must have felt the prick of necessity for ages and ages; during his
laborious tumbles amid the broken stones, he must have felt the advantage that it
would be for him to be relieved of his weight by means of wing-power; and all the
endeavours of his organism, striving to achieve a better lot, have not yet succeeded
in spreading bladewise his incipient wings.
</p>
<p>If we accept your theories, under the same conditions of urgent necessity, diet, climate
and habits, some are successful and manage to fly, others fail and remain clumsy pedestrians.
Short of resting satisfied with words and passing off chalk for cheese, I abandon
the explanations offered. Sheer ignorance is far preferable, for it prejudges nothing.
</p>
<p>But let us leave this backward one who is a stage behind his kinsmen, no one knows
why. Anatomy has its throwbacks, its halts, its sudden leaps, all of which defy our
curiosity. In the presence of the unfathomable problem of origins, the best thing
is to bow in all humility and pass on.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE LOCUSTS: THEIR EGGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What can our Locusts do? Not much in the way of manufactures. Their business in the
world is that of alchemists who in their gourdlike stomach elaborate and refine material
destined for higher objects. As I sit by my fireside, in the evening hours of meditation,
scribbling these notes upon the part which Locusts play in life, I am not prepared
to say that they have not contributed from time to time to the awakening of thought,
that magic mirror of things. They are on the earth to thrive as best they can and
to multiply, the latter being the highest law of animals charged with the manufacture
of foodstuffs.
</p>
<p>From the former point of view, if we except the all-devouring tribes which at times
imperil the very existence of Africa, the Locusts hardly attract our attention. They
are poor trenchermen; and I can surfeit a whole <span class="pageNum" id="pb379">[<a href="#pb379">379</a>]</span>barrack-room in my cages with a leaf of lettuce. As for the way in which they multiply,
that is another matter and one well worth a moment’s attention.
</p>
<p>At the same time we must not look for the nuptial eccentricities of the Grasshoppers.
Despite close similarity of structure, we are here in a new world as regards habits
and character. In the peaceful Locust clan, all that has to do with pairing is correct,
free from impropriety and conducted in accordance with the customary rites of the
entomological world. Any one keeping it under observation at the time of the procreative
frenzy will realize that the Locust came later than the Grasshopper, after the primitive
Orthopteron had sown his monstrous wild oats. There is nothing striking to be said
therefore on this always delicate subject; and I am very glad of it. Let us pass on
and come to the eggs.
</p>
<p>At the end of August, a little before noon-day, let us keep a close watch on the Italian
Locust (<i lang="la">Caloptenus italicus</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>), the boldest hopper of my neighbourhood. He is a sturdy fellow, very free with his
kicks; and he is clad in short wing-cases that hardly reach the tip of his abdomen.
His costume <span class="pageNum" id="pb380">[<a href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>is usually russet, with brown patches. A few more elegant ones edge the corselet with
a whitish hem which is prolonged over the head and wing-cases. The wings are colourless
except at the base, where they are pink; the hinder shins are claret-coloured.
</p>
<p>The mother selects a suitable spot for her eggs on the side where the sun is hottest
and always at the edge of the cage, whose wirework supplies her with a support in
case of need. Slowly and laboriously she drives her clumsy drill perpendicularly into
the sand, this drill being her abdomen, which disappears entirely. In the absence
of proper boring-tools, the descent underground is painful and hesitating, but is
at last accomplished thanks to perseverance, that powerful lever of the weak.
</p>
<p>The mother is now installed, half-buried in the soil. She gives slight starts, which
follow one another at regular intervals and seem to correspond with the efforts of
the oviduct as it expels the eggs. The neck gives throbs that lift and lower the head
with slight jerks. Apart from these pulsations of the head, the body, in its only
visible half, the fore-part, is absolutely stationary, so intense is the creature’s
absorption in her <span class="pageNum" id="pb381">[<a href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>laying. It is not unusual for a male, by comparison a dwarf, to come near and for
a long time to gaze curiously at the travailing mother. Sometimes also a few females
stand around, with their big faces turned towards their friend in labour. They seem
to take an interest in what is happening, perhaps saying to themselves that it will
be their turn soon.
</p>
<p>After some forty minutes of immobility, the mother suddenly releases herself and bounds
far away. She gives not a look at the eggs nor a touch of the broom to conceal the
aperture of the well. The hole closes of its own accord, as best it can, by the natural
falling-in of the sand. It is an extremely summary performance, marked by an utter
absence of maternal solicitude. The Locust mother is not a model of affection.
</p>
<p>Others do not forsake their eggs so recklessly. I can name the ordinary Locust with
the blue wings striped with black (<i lang="la">Œdipoda cœrulescens</i>, <span class="sc">Lin.</span>); also <i lang="la">Pachytylus nigrofasciatus</i>, <span class="sc">De Geer</span>, whose <i>cognomen</i> lacks point, for it ought to suggest either the malachite-green patches of the costume
or the white cross of the corselet.
</p>
<p>Both, when laying their eggs, adopt the <span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span>same attitude as the Italian Locust. The abdomen is driven perpendicularly into the
soil; the rest of the body partly disappears under the sliding sand. We again see
a long period of immobility, exceeding half an hour, together with little jerks of
the head, a sign of the underground efforts.
</p>
<p>The two mothers at last release themselves. With their hind-legs, lifted on high,
they sweep a little sand over the orifice of the pit and press it down by stamping
rapidly. It is a pretty sight to watch the precipitous action of their slender legs,
blue or pink, giving alternate kicks to the opening which is waiting to be plugged.
In this manner, with a lively trampling, the entrance to the house is closed and hidden
away. The hole in which the eggs were laid disappears from sight, so well obliterated
that no evil-intentioned creature could hope to discover it by means of vision alone.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all. The driving-power of the two rammers is the hinder thighs, which,
in rising and falling, scrape lightly against the edge of the wing-cases. This bow-play
produces a faint stridulation, similar to that with which the insect placidly lulls
itself to sleep in the sun.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Hen salutes the egg which she has just laid with a song of gladness; she announces
her maternal joys, to the whole neighbourhood. Even so does the Locust do in many
cases. With her thin scraper, she celebrates the advent of her family. She says:
</p>
<p>“<i lang="la">Non omnis moriar</i>; I have buried underground the treasure of the future; I have entrusted to the incubation
of the great hatcher a keg of germs which will take my place.”
</p>
<p>Everything on the site of the nest is put right in one brief spell of work. The mother
then leaves the spot, refreshes herself after her exertions with a few mouthfuls of
green stuff and prepares to begin again.
</p>
<p>The largest of the Acridians in our part of the country, the Grey Locust (<i lang="la">Pachytylus cinerescens</i>, <span class="sc">Fabr.</span>), rivals the African Locusts in size, without possessing their calamitous habits.
He is peace-loving and temperate and above reproach where the fruits of the earth
are concerned. From him we obtain a little information which is easily verified by
observing the insect in captivity.
</p>
<p>The eggs are laid about the end of April, a few days after the pairing, which lasts
<span class="pageNum" id="pb384">[<a href="#pb384">384</a>]</span>some little while. The female is armed at the tip of the abdomen—as, in varying degrees,
are the other Locust mothers—with four short excavators, arranged in pairs and shaped
like a hooked finger-nail. In the upper pair, which are larger, these hooks are turned
upwards; in the lower and smaller pair, they are turned downwards. They form a sort
of claw and are hard and black at the point; also they are scooped out slightly, like
a spoon, on their concave surface. These are the pick-axes, the trepans, the boring-tools.
</p>
<p>The mother bends her long abdomen perpendicularly to the line of the body. With her
four trepans she bites into the soil, lifting the dry earth a little; then, with a
very slow movement, she pushes down her abdomen, making no apparent effort, displaying
no excitement that would reveal the difficulty of the task.
</p>
<p>The insect is motionless and contemplative. The boring-implement could not work more
quietly if it were sinking into soft mould. It might all be happening in butter; and
yet what the bore traverses is caked, unyielding earth.
</p>
<p>It would be interesting, if it were only possible, <span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>to see the perforating-tool, the four gimlets, at work. Unfortunately, things happen
in the mysteries of the earth. No rubbish rises to the surface; nothing denotes the
underground labour. Little by little the abdomen sinks softly in, as our finger would
sink into a lump of soft clay. The four trepans must open the passage, crumbling the
earth into dust which is thrust back sideways by the abdomen and packed as with a
gardener’s dibble.
</p>
<p>The best site for laying the eggs is not always found at the first endeavour. I have
seen the mother drive her abdomen right in and make five wells one after the other
before finding a suitable place. The pits recognized as defective are abandoned as
soon as bored. They are vertical, cylindrical holes, of the diameter of a thick lead-pencil
and astonishingly neat. No wimble would produce cleaner work. Their length is that
of the insect’s abdomen, distended as far as the extension of the segments allows.
</p>
<p>At the sixth attempt, the spot is recognized as propitious. The laying thereupon takes
place, but nothing outside betrays the fact, so motionless does the mother seem, with
her abdomen immersed up to the hilt, which <span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span>causes the long wings lying on the ground to rumple and open out. The operation lasts
for a good hour.
</p>
<p>At last the abdomen rises, little by little. It is now near the surface, in a favourable
position for observation. The valves are in continual movement, whipping a mucus which
sets in milk-white foam. It is very similar to the work done by the Mantis when enveloping
her eggs in froth.
</p>
<p>The foamy matter forms a nipple at the entrance to the well, a knob which stands well
up and attracts the eye by the whiteness of its colour against the grey background
of the soil. It is soft and sticky, but hardens pretty soon. When this closing button
is finished, the mother moves away and troubles no more about her eggs, of which she
lays a fresh batch elsewhere after a few days have intervened.
</p>
<p>At other times, the terminal foamy paste does not reach the surface; it stops some
way down and, before long, is covered with the sand that slips from the margin. There
is then nothing outside to mark the place where the eggs were laid.
</p>
<p>Even when they concealed the mouth of the well under a layer of swept sand, my <span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>various captives, large and small, were too assiduously watched by me to foil my curiosity.
I know in every case the exact spot where the barrel of eggs lies. The time has come
to inspect it.
</p>
<p>The thing is easily discovered, an inch or an inch and a half down, with the point
of a knife. Its shape varies a good deal in the different species, but the fundamental
structure remains the same. It is always a sheath made of solidified foam, a similar
foam to that of the nests of the Praying Mantis. Grains of sand stuck together give
it a rough outer covering.
</p>
<p>The mother has not actually made this coarse cover, which constitutes a defensive
wall. The mineral wrapper results from the simple infiltration of the product, at
first semifluid and viscous, that accompanies the emission of the eggs. The wall of
the pocket absorbs it and, swiftly hardening, becomes a cemented scabbard, without
the agency of any special labour on the insect’s part.
</p>
<p>Inside, there is no foreign matter, nothing but foam and eggs. The latter occupy only
the lower portion, where they are immersed in a frothy matrix and packed one on top
<span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>of the other, slantwise. The upper portion, which is larger in some cases than in
others, consists solely of soft, yielding foam. Because of the part which it plays
when the young larvæ come into existence, I shall call it the ascending-shaft. A final
point worthy of observation is that all the sheaths are planted more or less vertically
in the soil and end at the top almost level with the ground.
</p>
<p>We will now describe specifically the layings which we find in the cages. That of
<i lang="la">Pachytylus cinerescens</i> is a cylinder six centimetres long and eight millimetres wide.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4140src" href="#xd31e4140">1</a> The upper end, when it emerges above the ground, swells into a nipple. All the rest
is of uniform thickness. The yellow-grey eggs are fusiform. Immersed in the froth
and arranged slantwise, they occupy only about a sixth part of the total length. The
rest of the structure is a fine, white, very powdery foam, soiled on the outside by
grains of earth. The eggs are not many in number, about thirty; but the mother lays
several batches.
</p>
<p>That of <i lang="la">P. nigrofasciatus</i> is shaped like a slightly curved cylinder, rounded off at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>lower end and cut square at the upper end. Its dimensions are an inch to an inch and
a half in length by a fifth of an inch in width. The eggs, about twenty in number,
are orange-red, adorned with a pretty pattern of tiny spots. The frothy matrix in
which they are contained is small in quantity; but above them there is a long column
of very fine, transparent and porous foam.
</p>
<p>The Blue-winged Locust (<i lang="la">Œdipoda cærulescens</i>) arranges her eggs in a sort of fat inverted comma. The lower portion contains the
eggs in its gourd-shaped pocket. They also are few in number, some thirty at most,
of a fairly bright orange-red, but unspotted. This receptable is crowned with a curved,
conical cap of foam.
</p>
<p>The lover of the mountain-tops, the Pedestrian Locust, adopts the same method as the
Blue-winged Locust, the denizen of the plains. Her sheath too is shaped like a comma
with the point turned upwards. The eggs, numbering about two dozen, are dark-russet
and are strikingly ornamented with a delicate lacework of inwrought spots. You are
quite surprised when you pass the magnifying-glass over this unexpected elegance.
Beauty leaves its impress everywhere, even <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>in the humble covering of an unsightly Acridian incapable of flight.
</p>
<p>The Italian Locust begins by enclosing her eggs in a keg and then, when on the point
of sealing her receptacle, thinks better of it: something essential, the ascending-shaft,
is lacking. At the upper end, at the point where it seems as if the barrel ought to
finish and close, a sudden compression changes the course of the work, which is prolonged
by the regulation foamy appendage. In this way, two storeys are obtained, clearly
defined on the outside by a deep groove. The lower, which is oval in shape, contains
the packet of eggs; the upper, tapering into the tail of a comma, consists of nothing
but foam. The two communicate by an opening that remains more or less free.
</p>
<p>The Locust’s art is not confined to these specimens of architecture. She knows how
to construct other strong-boxes for her eggs; she can protect them with all kinds
of edifices, some simple, others more ingenious, but all worthy of our attention.
Those with which we are familiar are very few compared with those of which we are
ignorant. No matter: what the cages reveal to us is sufficient to enlighten us as
to the general form. It remains <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>for us to learn how the building—an egg-warehouse below, a foamy turret above—is constructed.
</p>
<p>Direct observation is impracticable here. If we took it into our heads to dig and
to uncover the abdomen at work, the mother, worried by our importunity, would leap
away without telling us anything. Fortunately, one Locust, the strangest of my district,
reveals the secret to us. I speak of the Tryxalis, the largest member of the family,
after the Grey Locust.
</p>
<p>Though inferior to the last-named in size, how far she exceeds her in slenderness
of figure and, above all, in originality of shape! On our sun-scorched swards, none
has a leaping-apparatus to compare with hers. What hind-legs, what extravagant thighs,
what shanks! They are longer than the creature’s whole body.
</p>
<p>The result obtained hardly corresponds with this extraordinary length of limb. The
insect shuffles awkwardly along the edges of the vines, on the sand sparsely covered
with grass; it seems embarrassed by its shanks, which are slow to work. With this
equipment, weakened by its excessive length, the leap is awkward, describing but a
short <span class="pageNum" id="pb392">[<a href="#pb392">392</a>]</span>parabola. The flight alone, once taken, is of a certain range, thanks to an excellent
pair of wings.
</p>
<p>And then what a strange head! It is an elongated cone, a sugar-loaf, whose point,
turned up in the air, has earned for the insect the quaint epithet of <i>nasuta</i>, long-nosed. At the top of this cranial promontory are two large, gleaming, oval
eyes and two antennæ, flat and pointed, like dagger-blades. These rapiers are organs
of information. The Tryxalis lowers them, with a sudden swoop, to explore with their
points the object in which she is interested, the bit which she intends to nibble.
</p>
<p>To this abnormal shape we must add another characteristic that makes this long-shanks
an exception among Acridians. The ordinary Locusts, a peaceful tribe, live among themselves
without strife, even when driven by hunger. The Tryxalis, on the other hand, is somewhat
addicted to the cannibalism of the Grasshoppers. In my cages, in the midst of plenty,
she varies her diet and passes easily from salad to game. When tired of green stuff,
she does not scruple to exercise her jaws on her weaker companions.
</p>
<p>This is the creature capable of giving us <span class="pageNum" id="pb393">[<a href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>information about methods of laying. In my cages, as the result of an aberration due
no doubt to the boredom of captivity, it has never laid its eggs in the ground. I
have always seen it operating in the open air and even perched on high.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4181src" href="#xd31e4181">2</a> In the early days of October, the insect clings to the trelliswork of the cage and
very slowly discharges its batch of eggs, which we see gushing forth in a fine, foamy
stream, soon stiffening into a thick cylindrical cord, knotty and queerly curved.
It takes nearly an hour to complete the emission. Then the thing falls to the ground,
no matter where, unheeded by the mother, who never troubles about it again.
</p>
<p>The shapeless object, which varies greatly in different layings, is at first straw-coloured,
then darkens and turns rusty-brown on the morrow. The fore-part, which is the first
ejected, usually consists only of foam; the hinder part alone is fertile and contains
the eggs, buried in a frothy matrix. They are amber-yellow, about a score in number
and shaped like blunt spindles, eight to nine millimetres in length.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4187src" href="#xd31e4187">3</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sterile end, which is at least as big as the other, tells us that the apparatus
which produces the foam is in operation before the oviduct and afterwards goes on
while the latter is working.
</p>
<p>By what mechanism does the Tryxalis froth up her viscous product into a porous column
first and a mattress for the eggs afterwards? She must certainly know the method of
the Praying Mantis, who, with the aid of spoon-shaped valves, whips and beats her
glair and converts it into an <i lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i>; but in the Acridian’s case the frothing is done within and there is nothing outside
to betray its existence. The glue is foamy from the moment of its appearing in the
open air.
</p>
<p>In the Mantis’ building, that complex work of art, it is not a case of any special
talent, which the mother can exercise at will. The wonderful egg-casket comes from
the ordinary action of the mechanism, is merely the outcome of the organization. <i lang="la">A fortiori</i>, the Tryxalis, in discharging her clumsy sausage, is purely a machine. The thing
happens of itself.
</p>
<p>The same applies to the Locusts. They have no industry of their own specially devised
<span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>for laying eggs in strata in a keg of froth and extending this keg into an ascending-shaft.
The mother, with her abdomen plunged into the sand, expels at the same time eggs and
foamy glair. The whole becomes coordinated of its own accord simply by the mechanism
of the organs: on the outside, the frothy material, which coagulates and becomes encrusted
with a bulwark of earth; in the centre and at the bottom, the eggs arranged in regular
strata; at the upper end, a column of yielding foam.
</p>
<p>The Tryxalis and the Grey Locust are early hatchers. The latter’s family are already
hopping on the yellow patches of grass in August; before October is out, we are frequently
coming across young larvæ with pointed skulls. But in most of the other Acridians
the ovigerous sheaths last through the winter and do not open until the fine weather
returns. They are buried at no great depth in a soil which is at first loose and dusty
and which would not be likely to interfere with the emergence of the young larvæ if
it remained as it is; but the winter rains cake it together and turn it into a hard
ceiling. Suppose that the hatching takes place only a couple of inches down: how is
<span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>this crust to be broken, how is the larva to come up from below? The mother’s unconscious
art has provided for that.
</p>
<p>The Locust at his birth finds above him, not rough sand and hardened earth, but a
perpendicular tunnel whose solid walls keep all difficulties at a distance, a road
protected by a little easily-penetrated foam, an ascending-shaft, in short, which
brings the new-born larva quite close to the surface. Here a finger’s-breadth of serious
obstacle remains to be overcome.
</p>
<p>The greater part of the emergence therefore is accomplished without effort, thanks
to the terminal appendage of the egg-barrel. If, in my desire to follow the underground
work of the exodus, I experiment in glass tubes, almost all the new-born larvæ die,
exhausted with fatigue, under an inch of earth, when I do away with the liberating
appendage to the shells. They duly come to light if I leave the nest in its integral
condition, with the ascending-shaft pointing upwards. Though a mechanical product
of the organism, created without any effort of the creature’s intelligence, the Locust’s
edifice, we must confess, is singularly well thought out.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb397">[<a href="#pb397">397</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having come quite close to the surface with the aid of his ascending-shaft, what does
the young Locust do to complete his deliverance? He has still to pass through a layer
of earth about a finger’s-breadth in thickness; and that is very hard work for budding
flesh.
</p>
<p>If we keep the egg-cases in glass tubes during the favourable period, the end of spring,
we shall receive a reply to our question, provided that we have the requisite patience.
The Blue-winged Locusts lend themselves best to my investigations. I find some of
them busied with the work of liberation at the end of June.
</p>
<p>The little Locust, on leaving his shell, is a whitish colour, clouded with light red.
His progress is made by wormlike movements; and, so that it may be impeded as little
as possible, he is hatched in the condition of a mummy, that is to say, clad, like
the young Grasshoppers, in a temporary jacket, which keeps his antennæ, palpi and
legs closely fixed to his breast and belly. The head itself is very much bent. The
large hind-thighs are arranged side by side with the folded shanks, shapeless as yet,
short and as it were crooked. On the way, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>legs are slightly released; the hind-legs are straightened out and afford a fulcrum
for the sapping-work.
</p>
<p>The boring-tool, a repetition of the Grasshoppers’, is at the neck. There is here
a tumour that swells, subsides, throbs and strikes the obstacle with pistonlike regularity.
A tiny and most tender cervical bladder engages in a struggle with quartz. At the
sight of this capsule of glair striving to overcome the hardness of the mineral, I
am seized with pity. I come to the unhappy creature’s assistance by slightly damping
the layer to be passed through.
</p>
<p>Despite my intervention, the task is so arduous that, in an hour, I see the indefatigable
one make a progress of hardly a twenty-fifth of an inch. How you must labour, you
poor little thing, how you must persevere with your throbbing head and writhing loins,
before you can clear a passage for yourself through the thin layer which my kindly
drop of water has softened for you!
</p>
<p>The ineffectual efforts of the tiny mite tell us plainly that the emergence into the
light of day is an enormous undertaking, in which, but for the aid of the exit-tunnel,
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>mother’s work, the greater number would succumb.
</p>
<p>It is true that the Grasshoppers, similarly equipped, find it even more difficult
to make their way out of the earth. Their eggs are laid naked in the ground; no outward
passage is prepared for them beforehand. We may assume, therefore, that the mortality
must be very high among these improvident ones; legions are bound to perish at the
time of the exodus.
</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the comparative scarcity of Grasshoppers and the extreme abundance
of Locusts. And yet the number of eggs laid is about the same in both cases. The Locust
does not, in fact, limit herself to a single casket containing a score of eggs: she
puts into the ground two, three and more, which gives a total population approaching
that of the Decticus and other Grasshoppers. If, to the greater delight of the consumers
of small game, she thrives so well, whereas the Grasshopper, who is quite as fertile
but less ingenious, dwindles, does she not owe it to that superb invention, her exit-turret?
</p>
<p>One last word upon the tiny insect which, for days on end, fights away with its cervical
<span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>rammer. It is outside at last and rests for a moment, to recover from all that fatigue.
Then, suddenly, under the thrust of the throbbing blister, the temporary jacket splits.
The rags are pushed back by the hind-legs, which are the last to strip. The thing
is done: the creature is free, pale in colouring as yet, but possessing the final
larval form.
</p>
<p>Then and there, the hind-legs, hitherto stretched in a straight line, adopt the regulation
position; the legs fold under the great thighs; and the spring is ready to work. It
works. Little Locust makes his entrance into the world and hops for the first time.
I offer him a bit of lettuce the size of my finger-nail. He refuses. Before taking
nourishment, he must first mature and develop for a while in the sun.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE LOCUSTS: THE LAST MOULT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have just beheld a stirring sight: the last moult of a Locust, the extraction of
the adult from his larval wrapper. It is magnificent. The object of my enthusiasm
is the Grey Locust, the giant among our Acridians, who is common on the vines at vintage-time,
in September. On account of his size—he is as long as my finger—he is a better subject
for observation than any other of his tribe.
</p>
<p>The fat, ungraceful larva, a rough draft of the perfect insect, is usually pale-green;
but some also are bluish-green, dirty-yellow, red-brown or even ashen-grey, like the
grey of the adult. The corselet is strongly keeled and notched, with a sprinkling
of fine white worm-holes. The hind-legs, powerful as those of mature age, have a great
haunch striped with red and a long shank shaped like a two-edged saw.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wing-cases, which in a few days will project well beyond the tip of the abdomen,
are in their present state two skimpy, triangular pinions, touching back to back along
their upper edges and continuing the keel of the corselet. Their free ends stand up
like a pointed gable. These two coat-tails, of which the material seems to have been
clipped short with ridiculous meanness, just cover the creature’s nakedness at the
small of the back. They shelter two lean strips, the germs of the wings, which are
even more exiguous. In brief, the sumptuous, slender sails of the near future are
at present sheer rags, of such meagre dimensions as to be grotesque. What will come
out of these miserable envelopes? A marvel of stately elegance.
</p>
<p>Let us observe the proceedings in detail. Feeling itself ripe for transformation,
the creature clutches the trelliswork of the cage with its hinder and intermediary
legs. The fore-legs are folded and crossed over the breast and are not employed in
supporting the insect, which hangs in a reversed position, back downwards. The triangular
pinions, the sheaths of the wing-cases, open their peaked roof and separate sideways;
the two <span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span>narrow strips, the germs of the wings, stand in the centre of the uncovered space
and diverge slightly. The position for the moult has now been taken with the necessary
stability.
</p>
<p>The first thing to be done is to burst the old tunic. Behind the corselet, under the
pointed roof of the prothorax, pulsations are produced by alternate inflation and
deflation. A similar operation is performed in front of the neck and probably also
under the entire covering of the shell that is to be split. The delicacy of the membranes
at the joints enables us to perceive what is going on at these bare points, but the
harness of the corselet hides it from us in the central portion.
</p>
<p>It is there that the insect’s reserves of blood flow in waves. The rising tide expresses
itself in blows of an hydraulic battering-ram. Distended by this rush of humours,
by this injection wherein the organism concentrates its energies, the skin at last
splits along a line of least resistance prepared by life’s subtle previsions. The
fissure yawns all along the corselet, opening precisely over the keel, as though the
two symmetrical halves had been soldered. Unbreakable <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>any elsewhere, the wrapper yields at this median point which is kept weaker than the
rest. The split is continued some little way back and runs between the fastenings
of the wings; it goes up the head as far as the base of the antennæ, where it sends
a short ramification to the right and left.
</p>
<p>Through this break the back is seen, quite soft, pale, hardly tinged with grey. Slowly
it swells into a larger and larger hunch. At last it is wholly released. The head
follows, extracted from its mask, which remains in its place, intact in the smallest
particular, but looking strange with its great glassy eyes that do not see. The sheaths
of the antennæ, with not a wrinkle, with nothing out of order and with their normal
position unchanged, hang over this dead face, which is now translucent.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in emerging from their narrow sheaths, which enclosed them with such absolute
precision, the antennary threads encountered no resistance capable of turning their
scabbards inside out, or disturbing their shape, or even wrinkling them. Without injuring
the twisted containers, the contents, equal in size and themselves twisted, have managed
to slip out as easily as a smooth, <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>straight object would do, if sliding in a loose sheath. The extraction-mechanism will
be still more remarkable in the case of the hind-legs.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile it is the turn of the fore-legs and then of the intermediary legs to shed
armlets and gauntlets, always without the least rent, however small, without a crease
of rumpled material, without a trace of any change in the natural position. The insect
is now fixed to the top of the cage only by the claws of the long hind-legs. It hangs
perpendicularly, head downwards, swinging like a pendulum, if I touch the wire-gauze.
Four tiny hooks are what it hangs by. If they gave way, if they became unfastened,
the insect would be lost, for it is incapable of unfurling its enormous wings anywhere
except in space. But they will hold: life, before withdrawing from them, left them
stiff and solid, so as to be able firmly to support the struggles that are to follow.
</p>
<p>The wing-cases and wings now emerge. These are four narrow strips, faintly grooved
and looking like bits of paper ribbon. At this stage, they are scarcely a quarter
of their final length. So limp are they that they bend under their own weight <span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>and sprawl along the insect’s sides in the opposite direction to the normal. Their
free end, which should be turned backwards, now points towards the head of the Locust,
who is hanging upside down. Imagine four blades of thick grass, bent and battered
by a rainstorm, and you will have a fair picture of the pitiable bunch formed by the
future organs of flight.
</p>
<p>It must be no light task to bring things to the requisite stage of perfection. The
deeper-seated changes are already well-started, solidifying liquid mucilages, bringing
order out of chaos; but so far nothing outside betrays what is happening in that mysterious
laboratory where everything seems lifeless.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hind-legs become released. The great thighs appear in view, tinted
on their inner surface with a pale pink, which will soon turn into a streak of bright
crimson. The emergence is easy, the bulky haunch clearing the way for the tapering
knuckle.
</p>
<p>It is different with the shank. This, in the adult insect, bristles throughout its
length with a double row of hard, pointed spikes. Moreover, the lower extremity ends
in four large spurs. It is a genuine saw, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>with two parallel sets of teeth and so powerful that, if we dismiss the size from
our minds, it might be compared with the rough saw wielded by a quarryman.
</p>
<p>The larva’s shin is similarly constructed, so that the object to be extracted is contained
in a sheath as awkwardly shaped as itself. Each spur is enclosed in a similar spur,
each tooth fits into the hollow of a similar tooth; and the moulding is so exact that
we should obtain no more intimate contact if, instead of the envelope waiting to be
shed, we coated the limb with a layer of varnish distributed uniformly with a fine
brush.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless the sawlike tibia slips out of its long, narrow case without catching
in it at any point whatever. If I had not seen this happen over and over again, I
could never have believed it: the discarded legging is quite intact all the way down.
Neither the terminal spurs nor the two rows of spikes have caught in the delicate
mould. The saw has respected the dainty scabbard which a puff of my breath is enough
to tear; the formidable rake has slipped through without leaving the least scratch
behind it.
</p>
<p>I was far from expecting such a result as <span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="#pb408">408</a>]</span>this. Because of the spiked armour, I imagined that the leg would strip in scales
which came loose of themselves or yielded to rubbing, like dead cuticle. How greatly
did the reality exceed my expectations!
</p>
<p>From the spurs and spikes of the infinitely thin matrix there emerge spurs and spikes
that make the leg capable of cutting soft wood. This is done without violence or the
least inconvenience; and the discarded garment remains where it is, hanging by the
claws to the top of the cage, uncreased and untorn. The magnifying-glass shows not
a trace of rough usage. As the thing was before the excoriation, so it remains afterwards.
The legging of dead skin continues, down to the pettiest details, an exact replica
of the live leg.
</p>
<p>If any one suggested that we should extract a saw from some sort of goldbeater’s-skin
sheath which had been exactly moulded on the steel and that we should perform the
operation without producing the least tear, we should burst out laughing: the thing
is so flagrantly impossible. Life makes light of these impossibilities; it has methods
of realizing the absurd, in case of need. And the Locust’s leg tells us so.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span></p>
<p>If the saw of the shin were as hard as it is once it leaves its sheath, it would absolutely
refuse to come out without tearing to pieces the tight-fitting scabbard. The difficulty
therefore is evaded, for it is essential that the leggings, which form the only suspension-cords,
should remain intact in order to furnish a firm support until the deliverance is completed.
</p>
<p>The leg in process of liberation is not a limb fit for walking; it has not the rigidity
which it will presently possess. It is soft and highly flexible. In the portion which
the progress of the moult exposes to view, I see it bending and curving as I wish,
under the mere influence of its own weight, when I lift the cage. It is as supple
as elastic cord. And yet consolidation follows very rapidly, for the proper stiffness
will be acquired in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Farther on, in the part hidden from me by the sheath, the leg is certainly softer
and in a state of exquisite plasticity—I was almost saying fluidity—which allows it
to overcome difficult passages almost as a liquid would flow.
</p>
<p>The teeth of the saw are there, but have none of their future sharpness. I am able
<span class="pageNum" id="pb410">[<a href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>to strip a leg partially with the point of a knife and to extract the spines from
their horny mould. They are germs of spikes, flexible buds which bend under the slightest
pressure and resume their upright position as soon as the pressure is removed.
</p>
<p>These spikes lie backwards when the leg is about to be drawn out; they stand up again
and solidify while it emerges. I am witnessing not the mere stripping of gaiters from
limbs completely enclosed, but rather a sort of birth and growth which disconcert
us by their rapidity.
</p>
<p>Much in the same way, but with far less delicate precision, do the claws of the Crayfish,
at moulting-time, withdraw the soft flesh of their two fingers from the old stony
sheath.
</p>
<p>The shanks are free at last. They are folded limply in the groove of the thigh, there
to mature without moving. The abdomen is next stripped. Its fine tunic wrinkles, rumples
and pushes back towards the extremity, which alone for some time longer remains clad
in the moulting skin. Except at this point, the whole of the Locust is now bare.
</p>
<p>It is hanging perpendicularly, head down, <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>supported by the claws of the now empty leggings. Throughout this long and finikin
work, the four talons have never yielded, thanks to the delicacy and care with which
the extraction has been conducted.
</p>
<p>The insect, fixed by the stern to its cast skin, does not move. Its abdomen is immensely
swollen, apparently distended by the reserve of organizable humours which the expansion
of the wings and wing-cases will soon set in motion. The Locust is resting; he is
recovering from his exertions. Twenty minutes are spent in waiting.
</p>
<p>Then, by an effort of its back, the hanging insect raises itself and with its front
tarsi grabs hold of the cast skin fastened above it. Never did acrobat, swinging by
his feet from the bar of a trapeze, display greater strength of loin in lifting himself.
When this feat is accomplished, what remains to be done is nothing. With the support
which he has now gripped, the Locust climbs a little higher and reaches the wire gauze
of the cage. This takes the place of the brushwood which the free insect would utilize
for the transformation. He fixes himself to it with his four front feet. Then the
tip of the abdomen succeeds in releasing itself, <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span>whereupon, loosened with one last shake, the empty husk drops to the ground.
</p>
<p>The fact of its falling interests me, for I remember the stubborn persistency with
which the Cicada’s cast skin defies the winter winds without being detached from its
supporting twig. The Locust’s transfiguration is conducted in much the same way as
the Cicada’s. Then how is it that the Acridian gives himself such very shaky hangers?
The hooks hold so long as the work of tearing continues, though one would think that
this ought to bring down everything; they give way under a trifling shock so soon
as that work is done. We have, therefore, a very unstable condition of equilibrium
here, showing once more with what delicate precision the insect leaves its sheath.
</p>
<p>I said “tearing,” for want of a better word. But it is not quite that. The term implies
violence; and violence there cannot be any, because of the unsteady balance. Should
the Locust, upset by his exertions, come to the ground, it would be all up with him.
He would shrivel where he lies; or, at any rate, his organs of flight, being unable
to expand, would remain pitiful shreds. The Locust does not tear himself loose; he
<span class="pageNum" id="pb413">[<a href="#pb413">413</a>]</span>flows softly from his scabbard. It is as though he were forced out by a gentle spring.
</p>
<p>To return to the wings and wing-cases, which have made no apparent progress since
leaving the sheaths. They are still stumps, with fine longitudinal seams, not much
more than bits of rope. Their expansion, which will take more than three hours, is
reserved for the end, when the insect is completely stripped and in its normal position.
</p>
<p>We have seen the Locust turn head uppermost. This upright position is enough to restore
the natural arrangement of the wing-cases and wings. Being extremely flexible and
bent by their own weight, they were hanging down with their loose end pointing towards
the head of the inverted insect. Now, still by virtue of their own weight, they are
straightened and put the right way up. They are no longer curved like the petals of
a flower, they are no longer in an inverted position; but they still look miserably
insignificant.
</p>
<p>In its perfect state, the wing is fan-shaped. A radiating cluster of strong nervures
runs through it lengthwise and forms the framework of the fan, which is readily furled
or <span class="pageNum" id="pb414">[<a href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>unfurled. The intervening spaces are crossed by innumerable tiny bars which make of
the whole a network of rectangular meshes. The wing-case, which is coarser and much
less expanded, repeats this structure in squares.
</p>
<p>In neither case does any of the mesh show during the rope’s-end stage. All that we
see is a few wrinkles, a few winding furrows, which tell us that the stumps are bundles
of cunningly folded material reduced to their smallest volume.
</p>
<p>The expansion begins near the shoulder. Where at first nothing definite was to be
distinguished, we soon see a diaphanous area subdivided into meshes of exquisite precision.
Little by little, with a slowness that defies observation even through the magnifying-glass,
this area increases in extent at the expense of the shapeless terminal roll. My eyes
linger in vain on the confines of the two portions, the roll developing and the gauze
already developed: I see nothing, see no more than I should see in a sheet of water.
But wait a moment; and the tissue of squares stands out with perfect clearness.
</p>
<p>If we judged only by this first examination, we should really think that an organizable
<span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>fluid is abruptly congealing into a network of nervures; we should imagine that we
were in the presence of a crystallization similar, in its suddenness, to that of a
saline solution on the slide of a microscope. Well, no: things cannot be actually
happening like that. Life does not perform its tasks so hastily.
</p>
<p>I detach a half-developed wing and turn the powerful eye of the microscope upon it.
This time I am satisfied. On the confines where the network seemed to be gradually
woven, that network was really in existence. I can plainly see the longitudinal nervures,
already thick and strong; and I can also see, pale, it is true, and without relief,
the cross-bars. I find them all in the terminal roll, of which I succeed in unfolding
a few strips.
</p>
<p>It is obvious. The wing is not at this moment a fabric on the loom, through which
the procreative energies are driving their shuttle; it is a fabric already completed.
All that it lacks to be perfect is expansion and stiffness, even as our linen needs
only starching and ironing.
</p>
<p>The flattening out is finished in three hours or more. The wings and wing-cases stand
up on the Locust’s back like a huge set of <span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>sails, sometimes colourless, sometimes pale-green, as are the Cicada’s wings at the
beginning. We are amazed at their size when we think of the paltry bundles that represented
them at first. How did so much stuff manage to find room there!
</p>
<p>The fairy-tales tell us of a grain of hemp-seed that contained the underlinen of a
princess. Here is a grain that is even more astonishing. The one in the story took
years and years to sprout and multiply and at last to yield the quantity of hemp required
for the trousseau; the Locust’s supplies a sumptuous set of sails in a short space
of time.
</p>
<p>Slowly the proud crest, standing erect in four straight blades, acquires consistency
and colour. The latter turns the requisite shade on the following day. For the first
time the wings fold like a fan and lie in their places; the wing-cases lower their
outer edge and form a gutter which falls over the sides. The transformation is finished.
All that remains for the big Locust to do is to harden his tissues still further and
to darken the grey of his costume while revelling in the sun. Let us leave him to
enjoy himself and retrace our steps a little.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb417">[<a href="#pb417">417</a>]</span></p>
<p>The four stumps, which issued from their sheaths shortly after the corselet split
its keel down the middle, contain, as we have seen, the wings and wing-cases, with
their network of nervures. This network, if not perfect, has at least the general
plan of its numberless details mapped out. To unfurl these poor bundles and convert
them into generous sails, it is enough that the organism, acting in this case like
a forcing-pump, should shoot a stream of humours, which have been kept in reserve
for this moment, the hardest of all, into the little channels already prepared for
their reception. With the channel marked out in advance, a slight injection is sufficient
to explain the rapid spread.
</p>
<p>But what were the four strips of gauze while still contained in their sheaths? Are
the wings spatules and the three-cornered pinions of the larva moulds whose creases,
corners and sinuosities shape their contents in their own image and weave the tissues
of the future wing and wing-case? If we had to do with a real instance of moulding,
our brains could call a halt. We should say to ourselves that it was quite simple
for the thing moulded to correspond with the shape <span class="pageNum" id="pb418">[<a href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>of the mould. But our halt would be short-lived, for the mould in its turn would want
explaining: we should have to seek for a solution of its infinite intricacies. Let
us not go so far back; we should be utterly in the dark. Let us rather keep to facts
that can be observed.
</p>
<p>I examine through the magnifying-glass a pinion of a larva ripe for transformation.
I see a bundle of fairly thick nervures radiating fanwise. Other nervures, paler and
finer, are set in the intermediate spaces. Lastly, the fabric is completed by a number
of very short transversal lines, more delicate still and chevron-shaped.
</p>
<p>This, no doubt, gives a rough outline of the future wing-case; but how different from
the mature structure! The arrangement of the radiating nervures, the skeleton of the
edifice, is not at all the same; the network formed by the transversal veins in no
way suggests the complicated pattern which we shall see later. The rudimentary is
about to be succeeded by the infinitely complex, the crude by the exquisitely perfect.
The same remark applies to the wing-spatule and its outcome, the final wing.
</p>
<p>It is quite evident, when we have the preparatory <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>and the ultimate stage before our eyes at the same time: the larva’s pinion is not
merely a mould which elaborates the material in its own image and shapes the wing-case
upon the model of its hollow. No, the membrane which we are expecting is not yet inside
in the form of a bundle which, when unfurled, will astonish us with the size and the
extreme complexity of its texture. Or, to be accurate, it is there, but in a potential
state. Before becoming a real thing, it is a virtual thing, which is nothing as yet,
but which is capable of becoming something. It is there just as much as the oak is
inside its acorn.
</p>
<p>A fine, transparent rim binds the free edge both of the embryo wing and the embryo
wing-case. Under a powerful lens we can see a few uncertain outlines of the future
lacework. This might well be the factory in which life intends to set its materials
going. There is nothing else visible, nothing to suggest the prodigious network whose
every mesh will shortly have its form and place determined for it with geometrical
precision.
</p>
<p>There must therefore be something better and greater than a mould to make the organizable
<span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>matter shape itself into a sheet of gauze and describe the inextricable labyrinth
of the nervation. There is a primary plan, an ideal pattern which assigns to each
atom its precise place. Before the matter begins to move, the configuration is already
virtually traced, the courses of the plastic currents are already marked out. The
stones of our buildings are arranged in accordance with the architect’s considered
plan; they form an ideal assemblage before existing as a real assemblage. Similarly,
a Locust’s wing, that sumptuous piece of lace emerging from a miserable sheath, speaks
to us of another Architect, the Author of the plans which life must follow in its
labours.
</p>
<p>The genesis of living creatures offers to our contemplation, in an infinity of ways,
marvels far greater than those of the Acridian; but generally they pass unperceived,
overshadowed as they are by the veil of time. The lapse of years, with its slow mysteries,
robs us of the most astonishing spectacles, unless our minds be endowed with a stubborn
patience. Here, by exception, things take place with a swiftness that arrests even
a wavering attention.
</p>
<p>He who would, without wearisome delays, <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>catch a glimpse of the inconceivable dexterity with which life does its work has but
to go to the great Locust of the vines. The insect will show him that which, with
their extreme slowness, the sprouting seed, the budding leaf and the blossoming flower
hide from our curiosity. We cannot see a blade of grass grow; but we can easily witness
the growth of a Locust’s wings and wing-cases.
</p>
<p>We stand astounded at this sublime phantasmagoria of a grain of hemp-seed which in
a few hours becomes a superb piece of linen. What a proud artist is life, driving
its shuttle to weave the wings of a Locust, one of those insignificant insects of
which Pliny, long ago said:
</p>
<blockquote lang="la">
<p class="first">“<i>In his tam parvis, fere nullis, quæ vis, quæ sapientia, quam inextricabilis perfectis!</i>”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>How well the old naturalist was inspired on this occasion! Let us repeat after him:
</p>
<p>“What power, what wisdom, what indescribable perfection in the tiny corner of life
which the Locust of the vines has shown us!”
</p>
<p>I have heard that a learned enquirer, to whom life was but a conflict of physical
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span>chemical forces, did not despair of one day obtaining artificial organizable matter:
protoplasm, as the official jargon has it. Were it in my power, I should hasten to
satisfy this ambitious person.
</p>
<p>Very well, be it so: you have thoroughly prepared your protoplasm. By dint of long
hours of meditation, deep study, scrupulous care and inexhaustible patience, your
wishes have been fulfilled; you have extracted from your apparatus an albuminous glair,
which goes bad easily and stinks like the very devil in a few days’ time: in short,
filth. What do you propose to do with your product?
</p>
<p>Will you organize it? Will you give it the structure of a living edifice? Will you
take a hypodermic syringe and inject it between two impalpable films to obtain were
it only the wing of a Gnat?
</p>
<p>For that is more or less what the Locust does. He injects his protoplasm between the
two scales of the pinion; and the material becomes a wing-case, because it finds as
a guide the ideal archetype of which I spoke just now. It is controlled in its intricate
windings by a plan which existed before the injection, before the material itself.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span></p>
<p>Have you this archetype, this coordinator of forms, this primordial regulator, at
the end of your syringe? No? Then throw away your product! No life will ever spring
from that chemical ordure.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE FOAMY CICADELLA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In April, when the Swallow and the Cuckoo visit us, let us consider the fields for
a while, keeping our eyes on the ground, as befits the eager observer of insect-life.
We shall not fail to see, here and there, on the grass, little masses of white foam.
It might easily be taken for a spray of frothy spittle from the lips of a passer-by;
but there is so much of it that we soon abandon this first idea. Never would human
saliva suffice for so lavish an expenditure of foam, even if some one with nothing
better to do were to devote all his disgusting and misdirected zeal to the effort.
</p>
<p>While recognizing that man is blameless in the matter, the northern peasant has not
relinquished the name suggested by the appearance: he calls those strange flakes “Cuckoo-spit,”
after the bird whose note is then proclaiming the awakening of spring. <span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>The vagrant creature, unequal to the toils and delights of housekeeping, ejects it
at random, so they say, as it pays its flying visits to the homes of others, in search
of a resting-place for its egg.
</p>
<p>The interpretation does credit to the Cuckoo’s salivary powers, but not to the interpreter’s
intelligence. The other popular denomination is worse still: “Frog-spit!” My dear
good people, what on earth has the Frog or his slaver to do with it?<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4389src" href="#xd31e4389">1</a>
</p>
<p>The shrewder Provençal peasant also knows that vernal foam; but he is too cautious
to give it any wild names. My rustic neighbours, when I ask them about Cuckoo-spit
and Frog-spit, begin to smile and see nothing in those words but a poor joke. To my
questions on the nature of the thing they reply:
</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>Exactly! That’s the sort of answer I like, an answer not complicated with grotesque
explanations.
</p>
<p>Would you know the real perpetrator of this spittle? Rummage about the frothy <span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span>mass with a straw. You will extract a little yellow, pot-bellied, dumpy creature,
shaped like a Cicada without wings. That’s the foam-producer.
</p>
<p>When laid naked on another leaf, she brandishes the pointed tip of her little round
paunch. This at once betrays the curious machine which we shall see at work presently.
When older and still operating under the cover of its foam, the little thing becomes
a nymph, turns green in colour and gives itself stumps of wings fixed scarfwise on
its sides. From underneath its blunted head there projects, when it is working, a
little gimlet, a beak similar to that of the Cicadæ.
</p>
<p>In its adult form the insect is, in fact, a sort of very small-sized Cicada, for which
reason the entomologist capable of shaking off the trammels of nonsensical nomenclature
calls it simply the Foamy Cicadella. For this euphonic name, the diminutive of Cicada,
the others have substituted that horrible word Aphrophora. Orthodox science says,
<i lang="la">Aphrophora spumaria</i>, meaning Foamy Foambearer. The ear is none the better for this improvement. Let us
content ourselves with Cicadella, which respects the tympanum and does not reduplicate
the foam.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb427">[<a href="#pb427">427</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have consulted my few books as to the habits of the Cicadella. They tell me that
she punctures plants and makes the sap exude in foamy flakes. Under this cover, the
insect lives sheltered from the heat. A work recently compiled has one curious piece
of information: it tells me that I must get up early in the morning, inspect my crops,
pick any twig with foam on it and at once plunge it into a cauldron of boiling water.
</p>
<p>Oh, my poor Cicadella, this is a bad look-out! The author does not do things by halves.
I see him rising before the dawn, lighting a stove on wheels and pushing his infernal
contrivance through the midst of his lucern, his clover and his peas, to boil you
on the spot. He will have his work cut out for him. I remember a certain patch of
sainfoin of which almost every stalk had its foam-flakes. Had the stewing-process
been necessary, one might just as well have reaped the field and turned the whole
crop into herb-tea.
</p>
<p>Why these violent measures? Are you so very dangerous to the harvest, my pretty little
Cicada? They accuse you of draining the plant which you attack. Upon my word, they
are right: you drain it almost as dry as <span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span>the Flea does the Dog. But to touch another’s grass—you know it: doesn’t the fable
say so?—is a heinous crime, an offence which can be punished by nothing less drastic
than boiling water.
</p>
<p>Let us waste no more time on these agricultural entomologists with their murderous
designs. To hear them talk, one would think that the insect has no right to live.
Incapable of behaving like a ferocious landowner who becomes filled with thoughts
of massacre at the sight of a maggoty plum, I, more kindly, abandon my few rows of
peas and beans to the Cicadella: she will leave me my share, I am convinced.
</p>
<p>Besides, the insignificant ones of the earth are not the least rich in talent, in
an originality of invention which will teach us much concerning the infinite variety
of instinct. The Cicadella, in particular, possesses her recipes for aerated waters.
Let us ask her by what process she succeeds in giving such a fine head of froth to
her product, for the books that talk about boiling cauldrons and Cuckoo-spit are silent
on this subject, the only one worthy of narration.
</p>
<p>The foamy mass has no very definite shape and is hardly larger than a hazel-nut. It
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb429">[<a href="#pb429">429</a>]</span>remarkably persistent even when the insect is not working at it any longer. Deprived
of its manufacturer, who would not fail to keep it going, and placed on a watch-glass,
it lasts for more than twenty-four hours without evaporating or losing its bubbles.
This persistency is striking, compared with the rapidity with which soapsuds, for
instance, disappear.
</p>
<p>Prolonged duration of the foam is necessary to the Cicadella, who would exhaust herself
in the constant renewal of her products if her work were ordinary froth. Once the
effervescent covering is obtained, it is essential that the insect should rest for
a time, with no other task than to drink its fill and grow. And so the moisture converted
into froth possesses a certain stickiness, conducive to longevity. It is slightly
oily and trickles under one’s finger like a weak solution of gum.
</p>
<p>The bubbles are small and even, being all of the same dimensions. You can see that
they have been scrupulously gauged, one by one; you suspect the presence of a graduated
tube. Like our chemists and druggists, the insect must have its drop-measures.
</p>
<p>A single Cicadella is usually crouching invisible <span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span>in the depths of the foam; sometimes there are two or three or more. In such cases,
it is a fortuitous association, the fabrics of the several workers being so close
together that they merge into one common edifice.
</p>
<p>Let us see the work begin and, with the aid of a magnifying-glass, follow the creature’s
proceedings. With her sucker inserted up to the hilt and her six short legs firmly
fixed, the Cicadella remains motionless, flat on her stomach on the long-suffering
leaf. You expect to see froth issuing from the edge of the well, effervescing under
the action of the insect’s implement, whose lancets, ascending and descending in turns
and rubbing against each other like those of the Cicada, ought to make the sap foam
as it is forced out. The froth, so it would seem, must come ready-made from the puncture.
That is what the current descriptions of the Cicadella tell us; that was how I myself
pictured it on the authority of the writers. All this is a huge mistake: the real
thing is much more ingenious. It is a very clear liquid that comes up from the well,
with no more trace of foam than in a dew-drop. Even so the Cicada, who possesses <span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>similar tools, makes the spot at which she slakes her thirst give forth a limpid fluid,
with not a vestige of froth to it. Therefore, notwithstanding its dexterity in sucking
up liquids, the Cicadella’s mouth-apparatus has nothing to do with the manufacture
of the foamy mattress. It supplies the raw material; another implement works it up.
What implement? Have patience and we shall see.
</p>
<p>The clear liquid rises imperceptibly and glides under the insect, which at last is
half inundated. The work begins again without delay. To make white of egg into a froth
we have two methods: we can whip it, thus dividing the sticky fluid into thin flakes
and causing it to take in air in a network of cells; or we can blow into it and so
inject air-bubbles right into the mass. Of these two methods, the Cicadella employs
the second, which is less violent and more elegant. She blows her froth.
</p>
<p>But how is the blowing done? The insect seems incapable of it, being devoid of any
air-mechanism similar to that of the lungs. To breathe with tracheæ and to blow like
a bellows are incompatible actions.
</p>
<p>Agreed; but be sure that, if the insect <span class="pageNum" id="pb432">[<a href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>needs a blast of air for its manufactures, the blowing-machine will be there, most
ingeniously contrived. This machine the Cicadella possesses at the tip of her abdomen,
at the end of the intestine. Here, split lengthwise in the shape of a Y, a little
pocket opens and shuts in turns, a pocket whose two lips close hermetically when joined.
</p>
<p>Having said this, let us watch the performance. The insect lifts the tip of its abdomen
out of the bath in which it is swimming. The pocket opens, sucks in the air of the
atmosphere till it is full, then closes and dives down, the richer by its prize. Inside
the liquid, the apparatus contracts. The captive air escapes as from a nozzle and
produces a first bubble of froth. Forthwith the air-pocket returns to the upper air,
opens, takes in a fresh load and goes down again closed, to immerse itself once more
and blow in its gas. A new bubble is produced.
</p>
<p>And so it goes on with chronometrical regularity, from second to second, the blowing-machine
swinging upwards to open its valve and fill itself with air, downwards to dive into
the liquid and send out its gaseous contents. Such is the air-measurer, the drop-glass
<span class="pageNum" id="pb433">[<a href="#pb433">433</a>]</span>which accounts for the evenness of the frothy bubbles.
</p>
<p>Ulysses, the favourite of the gods, received from the storm-dispenser, Æolus, bags
in which the winds were confined. The carelessness of his crew, who untied the bags
to find out what they contained, let loose a tempest which destroyed the fleet. I
have seen those mythological wind-filled bags; I saw them years ago, when I was a
child.
</p>
<p>A peripatetic tinker, a son of Calabria, had set up between two stones the crucible
in which a tin soup-tureen and plates were to be remelted. Æolus did the blowing,
Æolus in the person of a little dark-skinned boy who, squatting on his heels, forced
air towards the forge by alternately squeezing two goatskin bags, one on the right
and one on the left. Thus must the prehistoric bronze-smelters have performed their
task, they whose workshops and whose remains of copper-slag I find on the hills near
my home: the blast of their furnaces was produced by these inflated skins.
</p>
<p>The machine employed by my Æolus is pathetically simple. The hide of a goat, with
the hair left on, is practically all that is necessary. It is a bag fastened at the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>bottom over a nozzle, open at the top and supplied, by way of lips, with two little
boards which, when brought together, close up the whole apparatus. These two stiff
lips are each furnished with a leather handle, one for the thumb, the other for the
four remaining fingers. The hand opens; the lips of the bag part and it fills with
air. The hand closes and brings the boards together; the air imprisoned in the compressed
bag escapes by the nozzle. The alternate working of the two bags gives a continuous
blast.
</p>
<p>Apart from continuity, which is not a favourable condition when the gas has to be
discharged in small bubbles, the Cicadella’s bellows works like the Calabrian tinker’s.
It is a flexible pocket with stiff lips, which alternately part and unite, opening
to let the air enter and closing to keep it imprisoned. The contraction of the sides
takes the place of the shrinking of the bag and puffs out the gaseous contents when
the pocket is immersed.
</p>
<p>He certainly had a lucky inspiration who first thought of confining the wind in a
bag, as mythology tells us that Æolus did. The goatskin turned into a bellows gave
us our metals, the essential matter whereof our <span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span>tools are made. Well, in this art of expelling air, an enormous source of progress,
the Cicadella was the pioneer. She was blowing her froth before Tubalcain thought
of urging the fire of his forge with a leather pouch. She was the first to invent
bellows.
</p>
<p>When, bubble by bubble, the foamy wrapper covers the insect to a height which the
uplifted tip of her belly is unable to reach, it is no longer possible to take in
air and the effervescence stops. Nevertheless, the gimlet that extracts the sap goes
on working, for nourishment must be obtained. As a rule then, in the sloping part,
the superfluous liquid, that which is not converted into foam, collects and forms
a drop of perfectly clear liquid.
</p>
<p>What does this limpid fluid lack in order to turn white and effervesce? Nothing but
air blown into it, one would think. I am able to substitute my own devices for the
Cicadella’s syringe. I place between my lips a very slender glass tube and with delicate
puffs send my breath into the drop of moisture. To my great surprise, it does not
froth up. The result is just the same as that which I should have with plain water
from the tap.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>Instead of a plentiful, lasting, slow-subsiding foam, like that with which the insect
covers itself, all that I obtain is a miserable ring of bubbles, which burst as soon
as they appear. And I am equally unsuccessful with the liquid which the Cicadella
collects under her abdomen at the start, before working her bellows. What is wrong
in each case? The foamy product and its generating liquid shall tell us.
</p>
<p>The first is oily to the touch, gummy and as fluid as, for instance, a weak solution
of albumen would be; the second flows as readily as plain water. The Cicadella therefore
does not draw from her well a liquid liable to effervesce merely by the action of
the blow-pocket; she adds something to what oozes from the puncture, adds a viscous
element which gives cohesion and makes frothing possible, even as a boy adds soap
to the water which he blows into iridescent bubbles through a straw.
</p>
<p>Where then does the insect keep its soap-works, its manufactory of the effervescent
element? Evidently in the blow-pocket itself. It is here that the intestine ends and
here that albuminous products, furnished either by the digestive canal or by special
glands, <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>can be expelled in infinitesimal doses. Each whiff sent out is thus accompanied by
a trifle of adhesive matter, which dissolves in the water, making it sticky and enabling
it to retain the captive air in permanent bubbles. The Cicadella covers herself with
an icing of which her intestine is to some extent the manufacturer.
</p>
<p>This method brings us back to the industry of the lily-dweller, the grub which makes
itself a loathsome armour out of its excretions;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4469src" href="#xd31e4469">2</a> but what a distance between the heap of ordure which it wears on its back and the
Cicadella’s aerated mattress!
</p>
<p>Another fact, more difficult to explain, attracts our attention. A multitude of low-growing,
herbaceous plants, whose sap starts flowing in April, suit the frothy insect, without
distinction of species, genus or family. I could almost make a list of the non-ligneous
vegetation of my neighbourhood by cataloguing the plants on which the little creature’s
foam is to be found in greater or lesser abundance. A few experiments will tell us
how indifferent the Cicadella is to both <span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>the nature and the properties of the plant which she adopts as her home.
</p>
<p>I pick the insect out of its froth with the tip of a hair-pencil and place it on some
other plant, of an opposite flavour, letting the strong come after the mild, the spicy
after the insipid, the bitter after the sweet. The new encampment is accepted without
hesitation and soon covered with foam. For instance, a Cicadella taken from the bean,
which has a neutral flavour, thrives excellently on the spurges, full of pungent milky
sap, and particularly on <i lang="la">Euphorbia serrata</i>, the narrow notch-leaved spurge, which is one of her favourite dwelling-places. And
she is equally satisfied when moved from the highly-spiced spurge to the comparatively
flavourless bean.
</p>
<p>This indifference is surprising when we reflect how scrupulously faithful other insects
are to their plants. There are undoubtedly stomachs expressly made to drink corrosive
and assimilate toxic matters. The caterpillar of <i lang="la">Acherontia atropos</i>, the Death’s-head Hawk-moth, eats its fill of potato-leaves, which are seasoned with
solanin; the caterpillar of the Spurge-moth browses in these parts on the upright
red spurge (<i lang="la">Euphorbia <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>characias</i>), whose milk produces much the same effect as red-hot iron on the tongue; but neither
one nor the other would pass from these narcotics or these caustics to utterly insipid
fare.
</p>
<p>How does the Cicadella manage to feed on anything and everything, for she evidently
obtains nourishment while putting a head on her liquid? I see her thrive, either of
her own accord or by my devices, on the common buttercup (<i lang="la">Ranunculus acris</i>), which has a flavour unequalled save by Cayenne pepper; on the Italian arum (<i lang="la">Arum italicum</i>), the veriest particle of whose leaves is enough to burn the lips; on the traveller’s
joy, or virgin’s bower (<i lang="la">Clematis vitalba</i>), the famous beggars’ herb, which reddens the skin and produces the sores in request
among our sham cripples. After these highly-seasoned condiments, she will promptly
accept the mild sainfoin, the scented savory, the bitter dandelion, the sweet field
eringo, in short, anything that I put before her, whether full-flavoured or tasteless.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this strange catholicity of diet might well be only apparent.
When the Cicadella punctures this or that herb, of whatever species, all that she
does <span class="pageNum" id="pb440">[<a href="#pb440">440</a>]</span>is to extract an almost neutral liquid, just as the roots draw it from the soil; she
does not admit to her fountain the fluids worked up into essential principles. The
liquid that trickles forth under the insect’s gimlet and forms a bead at the bottom
of the foamy mass is perfectly clear.
</p>
<p>I have gathered this drop on the spurge, the arum, the clematis and the buttercup.
I expected to find a fire-water, pungent as the sap of those different plants. Well,
it is nothing of the kind; it lacks all savour; it is water or little more. And this
insipid stuff has issued from a reservoir of vitriol.
</p>
<p>If I prick the spurge with a fine needle, that which rises from the puncture is a
white, milky drop, tasting horribly bitter. When the Cicadella pushes in her drill,
a clear, flavourless fluid oozes out. The two operations seem to be directed towards
different sources.
</p>
<p>How does she manage to draw a liquid that is clear and harmless from the same barrel
whence my needle brings up something milky and burning? Can the Cicadella, with her
instrument, that incomparable alembic, divide the fierce fluid into two, admitting
the neutral and rejecting the peppery? <span class="pageNum" id="pb441">[<a href="#pb441">441</a>]</span>Can she be drawing on certain vessels whose sap, not yet elaborated, has not acquired
its final virulence? The delicate vegetable anatomy is helpless in the presence of
the tiny creature’s pump. I give up the problem.
</p>
<p>When the Cicadella is exploring the spurge, as frequently happens, she has a serious
reason for not admitting to her fountain all that would be yielded by simple bleeding,
such as my needle would produce. The milky juice of the plant would be fatal to her.
</p>
<p>I gather a drop or two of the liquid that trickles from a cut stalk and instal a Cicadella
in it. The insect is not comfortable: I can see this by its efforts to escape. My
hair-pencil pushes the fugitive back into the pool of milk, rich in dissolved rubber.
Soon this rubber settles into clots similar to crumbs of cheese; the insect’s legs
become clad in gaiters that seem made of casein; a coating of gum obstructs the breathing-valves;
possibly also the extremely delicate skin is hurt by the blistering qualities of the
milky sap. If kept for some time in that environment, the Cicadella dies.
</p>
<p>Even so would she die if her gimlet, working simply as a needle, brought the milk
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb442">[<a href="#pb442">442</a>]</span>the spurge to the surface. A sifting takes place then, which allows almost pure water
to issue from the source that gives the wherewithal for making the froth. A subtle
exhaustion-process, whose mechanism is hidden from our curiosity, a piston-play of
unrivalled delicacy, effects this marvellous work of purification.
</p>
<p>Water is always water, whether it come from the stagnant pool or the clear stream,
from a poisonous liquid or a healing infusion; and it possesses the same properties,
when it is rid of its impurities by distillation. In like manner, the sap, whether
furnished by the spurge or the bean, the clematis or the sainfoin, the buttercup or
the borage, is of the same watery nature when the Cicadella’s syphon, by a reducing-process
which would be the envy of our stills, has deprived it of its peculiar properties,
which vary so greatly in different plants.
</p>
<p>This would explain how the insect makes its froth rise on the first plant that it
comes across. Everything suits it, because its apparatus reduces any sap to the condition
of plain water. The inimitable well-sinker is able to produce the limpid from the
cloudy and the harmless from the toxic.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb443">[<a href="#pb443">443</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may possibly happen that the insect’s well supplies water that is not quite pure.
If left to evaporate in a watch-glass, the clear drop that trickles from the mass
of foam yields a thin white residue, which dissolves by effervescence in nitric acid.
This residue might well be carbonate of potash. I also suspect the presence of traces
of albumen.
</p>
<p>Obviously, the Cicadella finds something to feed on at the bottom of the puncture.
Now what does she consume? To all appearances, something with an albuminous basis,
for the pigmy herself is, for the most part, but a grain of similar matter. This element
is plentiful in all plants; and it is probable that the insect uses it lavishly to
make up for the expenditure of gum needed for the formation of froth. Some albuminous
product, perfected in the digestive canal and discharged by the intestine as and when
the blow-pocket expels its bubble of air, might well give the liquid the power of
swelling into a foam that lasts for a long time.
</p>
<p>If we ask ourselves what advantage the Cicadella derives from her mass of froth, a
very excellent answer is at once suggested: <span class="pageNum" id="pb444">[<a href="#pb444">444</a>]</span>the insect keeps itself cool under that shelter, hides itself from the eyes of its
persecutors and is protected against the rays of the sun and the attacks of parasites.
</p>
<p>The Lily-beetle makes a similar use of the mantle of her own dirt; but she, most unhappily
for herself, flings off her nasty cloak and descends naked from the plant to the ground,
where she has to bury herself to slaver her cocoon. At this critical moment, the Flies
lie in wait for her and entrust her with their eggs, the germs of parasites which
will eat into her body.
</p>
<p>The Cicadella is better-advised and altogether escapes the dangers attendant on a
removal. Subject to certain summary changes which never interrupt her activity, she
assumes the adult form in the very heart of her bastion, under the shelter of a viscous
rampart capable of repelling any assailant. Here she enjoys perfect security when
the difficult hour has come for tearing off her old skin and putting on another, brand-new
and more decorative; here she finds profound peace for her excoriation and for the
display of the attire of a riper age.
</p>
<p>The insect does not leave its cool covering until it is grown up, when it appears
in <span class="pageNum" id="pb445">[<a href="#pb445">445</a>]</span>the form of a pretty little, brown-striped Cicadella. It is then able to take enormous
and sudden leaps, which carry it far from the aggressor; and it leads an easy life,
untroubled by the foe.
</p>
<p>Looked upon as a system of defence, the frothy stronghold is indeed a magnificent
invention, much superior to the squalid work of the invader of the lily. And, strange
to say, the system has no imitators among the genera most nearly allied to the froth-blower.
</p>
<p>In her larval form, the Asparagus-beetle is victimized by the Fly because she does
not follow the example of her cousin, the Lily-beetle, and clothe herself in her own
droppings. Even so, on the grass, on the trees displaying their tender leaves, other
Cicadellæ abound, no less exposed to danger from the Warbler seeking a succulent morsel
for his little ones; and, as they draw out the sap through the punctures made by their
suckers, not one of them thinks of making it effervesce. Yet they too possess the
elevator-pump, which they all work in the same manner; only they do not know how to
turn the end of their intestine into a bellows. Why not? Because instincts are not
to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>acquired. They are primordial aptitudes, bestowed here and denied there; time cannot
awaken them by a slow incubation, nor are they decreed by any similarity of organization.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
